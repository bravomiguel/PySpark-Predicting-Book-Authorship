        "\n",
        "**Aim**: Hands-on lab showing how to use PySpark to predict the authorship of a set of books (either Jane Austen or Shakespeare), by clustering based on book content. \n",
        "\n",
        "Note, this notebook has been specifically written to be run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb). You may get errors if using other iPython IDE's (e.g. Jupyter Notebook).\n",
        "\n",
        "**What you'll learn**: Learn basics of carrying out data pre-processing and ML (in this case k-means clustering) using PySpark. \n",
        "\n",
        "**So what**: PySpark is one of the most widely used frameworks for processing and analysing big data, i.e. data with these characteristics;\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "When it comes to these kinds of data (which is most data nowadays), traditional tools (e.g. pandas, SQL, etc.) start to fall over, and PySpark really comes into its own.\n",

        "**PySpark key concepts**:\n",
        "* *What is it*: PySpark is the Python API for [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org), an open-source analytics engine for large-scale data processing.  \n",
        "* *RDD*: Resilient Distributed Dataset. Basic data object in Spark where data is stored in chunks, allowing for parallel processing over a compute cluster (essential for big data). Can handle structured/unstructured data (also essential).\n",
        "* *MapReduce*: Key technique for transforming data. First you map data points to values to create (key, value) pairs. Then you reduce data points based on keys. Textbook example is doing word count over large-scale text corpus, e.g.\n",

        "* *DAG*: Directed Acyclic Graph. Link of RDD's mapping out list of tasks performed on RDD's. Allows for lazy evaluation where spark executes tasks only when it has to (by remembering all tasks leading up to this).\n",
        "* *How it works under the hood*:\n",

        "**Key Analysis Steps**:\n",
        "1.   **Setting up PySpark** on Google Colab\n",
        "2.   **Vectorising books**, by extracting 'stop word' frequency vectors for each book \n",
        "3.   **Performing k-means clustering** on vector representations to separate books into two groups (hopefully reflective of authorship)\n",
        "4.   **Vectorising books again**, this time extracting 'all word' frequency vectors, then performing feature hashing to reduce to fixed width vectors.\n",
        "5.   **Performing k-means clustering again**, to see if new vector representations allow for more accurate grouping of books by author\n",

SCENE 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. A street\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, solus\\r\\n\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Now is the winter of our discontent\\r\\n    Made glorious summer by this sun of York;\\r\\n    And all the clouds that lour\\'d upon our house\\r\\n    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\\r\\n    Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\\r\\n    Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;\\r\\n    Our stern alarums chang\\'d to merry meetings,\\r\\n    Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.\\r\\n    Grim-visag\\'d war hath smooth\\'d his wrinkled front,\\r\\n    And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds\\r\\n    To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\\r\\n    He capers nimbly in a lady\\'s chamber\\r\\n    To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\\r\\n    But I-that am not shap\\'d for sportive tricks,\\r\\n    Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass-\\r\\n    I-that am rudely stamp\\'d, and want love\\'s majesty\\r\\n    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph- \\r\\n    I-that am curtail\\'d of this fair proportion,\\r\\n    Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,\\r\\n    Deform\\'d, unfinish\\'d, sent before my time\\r\\n    Into this breathing world scarce half made up,\\r\\n    And that so lamely and unfashionable\\r\\n    That dogs bark at me as I halt by them-\\r\\n    Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\\r\\n    Have no delight to pass away the time,\\r\\n    Unless to spy my shadow in the sun\\r\\n    And descant on mine own deformity.\\r\\n    And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover\\r\\n    To entertain these fair well-spoken days,\\r\\n    I am determined to prove a villain\\r\\n    And hate the idle pleasures of these days.\\r\\n    Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\\r\\n    By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,\\r\\n    To set my brother Clarence and the King\\r\\n    In deadly hate the one against the other;\\r\\n    And if King Edward be as true and just\\r\\n    As I am subtle, false, and treacherous, \\r\\n    This day should Clarence closely be mew\\'d up-\\r\\n    About a prophecy which says that G\\r\\n    Of Edward\\'s heirs the murderer shall be.\\r\\n    Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.\\r\\n\\r\\n             Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY\\r\\n\\r\\n    Brother, good day. What means this armed guard\\r\\n    That waits upon your Grace?\\r\\n  CLARENCE. His Majesty,\\r\\n    Tend\\'ring my person\\'s safety, hath appointed\\r\\n    This conduct to convey me to th\\' Tower.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Upon what cause?\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Because my name is George.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:\\r\\n    He should, for that, commit your godfathers.\\r\\n    O, belike his Majesty hath some intent\\r\\n    That you should be new-christ\\'ned in the Tower.\\r\\n    But what\\'s the matter, Clarence? May I know?\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest \\r\\n    As yet I do not; but, as I can learn,\\r\\n    He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,\\r\\n    And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,\\r\\n    And says a wizard told him that by G\\r\\n    His issue disinherited should be;\\r\\n    And, for my name of George begins with G,\\r\\n    It follows in his thought that I am he.\\r\\n    These, as I learn, and such like toys as these\\r\\n    Hath mov\\'d his Highness to commit me now.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Why, this it is when men are rul\\'d by women:\\r\\n    \\'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;\\r\\n    My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, \\'tis she\\r\\n    That tempers him to this extremity.\\r\\n    Was it not she and that good man of worship,\\r\\n    Antony Woodville, her brother there,\\r\\n    That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,\\r\\n    From whence this present day he is delivered?\\r\\n    We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. By heaven, I think there is no man is secure\\r\\n    But the Queen\\'s kindred, and night-walking heralds \\r\\n    That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.\\r\\n    Heard you not what an humble suppliant\\r\\n    Lord Hastings was, for her delivery?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Humbly complaining to her deity\\r\\n    Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.\\r\\n    I\\'ll tell you what-I think it is our way,\\r\\n    If we will keep in favour with the King,\\r\\n    To be her men and wear her livery:\\r\\n    The jealous o\\'er-worn widow, and herself,\\r\\n    Since that our brother dubb\\'d them gentlewomen,\\r\\n    Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.\\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:\\r\\n    His Majesty hath straitly given in charge\\r\\n    That no man shall have private conference,\\r\\n    Of what degree soever, with your brother.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Even so; an\\'t please your worship, Brakenbury,\\r\\n    You may partake of any thing we say:\\r\\n    We speak no treason, man; we say the King\\r\\n    Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen\\r\\n    Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous; \\r\\n    We say that Shore\\'s wife hath a pretty foot,\\r\\n    A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;\\r\\n    And that the Queen\\'s kindred are made gentlefolks.\\r\\n    How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?\\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee,\\r\\n    fellow,\\r\\n    He that doth naught with her, excepting one,\\r\\n    Were best to do it secretly alone.\\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. What one, my lord?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?\\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and\\r\\n    withal\\r\\n    Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will\\r\\n    obey.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. We are the Queen\\'s abjects and must obey.\\r\\n    Brother, farewell; I will unto the King;\\r\\n    And whatsoe\\'er you will employ me in-\\r\\n    Were it to call King Edward\\'s widow sister- \\r\\n    I will perform it to enfranchise you.\\r\\n    Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood\\r\\n    Touches me deeper than you can imagine.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. I know it pleaseth neither of us well.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;\\r\\n    I will deliver or else lie for you.\\r\\n    Meantime, have patience.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. I must perforce. Farewell.\\r\\n                          Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and guard\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Go tread the path that thou shalt ne\\'er return.\\r\\n    Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so\\r\\n    That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,\\r\\n    If heaven will take the present at our hands.\\r\\n    But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter LORD HASTINGS\\r\\n\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Good time of day unto my gracious lord!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!\\r\\n    Well are you welcome to the open air. \\r\\n    How hath your lordship brook\\'d imprisonment?\\r\\n  HASTINGS. With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;\\r\\n    But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks\\r\\n    That were the cause of my imprisonment.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;\\r\\n    For they that were your enemies are his,\\r\\n    And have prevail\\'d as much on him as you.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. More pity that the eagles should be mew\\'d\\r\\n    Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. What news abroad?\\r\\n  HASTINGS. No news so bad abroad as this at home:\\r\\n    The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,\\r\\n    And his physicians fear him mightily.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.\\r\\n    O, he hath kept an evil diet long\\r\\n    And overmuch consum\\'d his royal person!\\r\\n    \\'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.\\r\\n    Where is he? In his bed?\\r\\n  HASTINGS. He is.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Go you before, and I will follow you. \\r\\n                                                   Exit HASTINGS\\r\\n    He cannot live, I hope, and must not die\\r\\n    Till George be pack\\'d with posthorse up to heaven.\\r\\n    I\\'ll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence\\r\\n    With lies well steel\\'d with weighty arguments;\\r\\n    And, if I fail not in my deep intent,\\r\\n    Clarence hath not another day to live;\\r\\n    Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,\\r\\n    And leave the world for me to bustle in!\\r\\n    For then I\\'ll marry Warwick\\'s youngest daughter.\\r\\n    What though I kill\\'d her husband and her father?\\r\\n    The readiest way to make the wench amends\\r\\n    Is to become her husband and her father;\\r\\n    The which will I-not all so much for love\\r\\n    As for another secret close intent\\r\\n    By marrying her which I must reach unto.\\r\\n    But yet I run before my horse to market.\\r\\n    Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns;\\r\\n    When they are gone, then must I count my gains.         Exit\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. Another street\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter corpse of KING HENRY THE SIXTH, with halberds to guard it;\\r\\nLADY ANNE being the mourner, attended by TRESSEL and BERKELEY\\r\\n\\r\\n  ANNE. Set down, set down your honourable load-\\r\\n    If honour may be shrouded in a hearse;\\r\\n    Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament\\r\\n    Th\\' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.\\r\\n    Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!\\r\\n    Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!\\r\\n    Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!\\r\\n    Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost\\r\\n    To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,\\r\\n    Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,\\r\\n    Stabb\\'d by the self-same hand that made these wounds.\\r\\n    Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life\\r\\n    I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.\\r\\n    O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!\\r\\n    Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it! \\r\\n    Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!\\r\\n    More direful hap betide that hated wretch\\r\\n    That makes us wretched by the death of thee\\r\\n    Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,\\r\\n    Or any creeping venom\\'d thing that lives!\\r\\n    If ever he have child, abortive be it,\\r\\n    Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,\\r\\n    Whose ugly and unnatural aspect\\r\\n    May fright the hopeful mother at the view,\\r\\n    And that be heir to his unhappiness!\\r\\n    If ever he have wife, let her be made\\r\\n    More miserable by the death of him\\r\\n    Than I am made by my young lord and thee!\\r\\n    Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,\\r\\n    Taken from Paul\\'s to be interred there;\\r\\n    And still as you are weary of this weight\\r\\n    Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry\\'s corse.\\r\\n                                [The bearers take up the coffin]\\r\\n\\r\\n                      Enter GLOUCESTER \\r\\n\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.\\r\\n  ANNE. What black magician conjures up this fiend\\r\\n    To stop devoted charitable deeds?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,\\r\\n    I\\'ll make a corse of him that disobeys!\\r\\n  FIRST GENTLEMAN. My lord, stand back, and let the coffin\\r\\n    pass.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Unmannerd dog! Stand thou, when I command.\\r\\n    Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,\\r\\n    Or, by Saint Paul, I\\'ll strike thee to my foot\\r\\n    And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.\\r\\n                               [The bearers set down the coffin]\\r\\n  ANNE. What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?\\r\\n    Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,\\r\\n    And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.\\r\\n    Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!\\r\\n    Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,\\r\\n    His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst. \\r\\n  ANNE. Foul devil, for God\\'s sake, hence and trouble us not;\\r\\n    For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell\\r\\n    Fill\\'d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.\\r\\n    If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,\\r\\n    Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.\\r\\n    O, gentlemen, see, see! Dead Henry\\'s wounds\\r\\n    Open their congeal\\'d mouths and bleed afresh.\\r\\n    Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,\\r\\n    For \\'tis thy presence that exhales this blood\\r\\n    From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;\\r\\n    Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural\\r\\n    Provokes this deluge most unnatural.\\r\\n    O God, which this blood mad\\'st, revenge his death!\\r\\n    O earth, which this blood drink\\'st, revenge his death!\\r\\n    Either, heav\\'n, with lightning strike the murd\\'rer dead;\\r\\n    Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,\\r\\n    As thou dost swallow up this good king\\'s blood,\\r\\n    Which his hell-govern\\'d arm hath butchered.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Lady, you know no rules of charity,\\r\\n    Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses. \\r\\n  ANNE. Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:\\r\\n    No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. But I know none, and therefore am no beast.\\r\\n  ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. More wonderful when angels are so angry.\\r\\n    Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,\\r\\n    Of these supposed crimes to give me leave\\r\\n    By circumstance but to acquit myself.\\r\\n  ANNE. Vouchsafe, diffus\\'d infection of a man,\\r\\n    Of these known evils but to give me leave\\r\\n    By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have\\r\\n    Some patient leisure to excuse myself.\\r\\n  ANNE. Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make\\r\\n    No excuse current but to hang thyself.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. By such despair I should accuse myself.\\r\\n  ANNE. And by despairing shalt thou stand excused\\r\\n    For doing worthy vengeance on thyself\\r\\n    That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Say that I slew them not? \\r\\n  ANNE. Then say they were not slain.\\r\\n    But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I did not kill your husband.\\r\\n  ANNE. Why, then he is alive.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward\\'s hands.\\r\\n  ANNE. In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw\\r\\n    Thy murd\\'rous falchion smoking in his blood;\\r\\n    The which thou once didst bend against her breast,\\r\\n    But that thy brothers beat aside the point.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I was provoked by her sland\\'rous tongue\\r\\n    That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.\\r\\n  ANNE. Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,\\r\\n    That never dream\\'st on aught but butcheries.\\r\\n    Didst thou not kill this king?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I grant ye.\\r\\n  ANNE. Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to\\r\\n    Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!\\r\\n    O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. The better for the King of Heaven, that hath\\r\\n    him. \\r\\n  ANNE. He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Let him thank me that holp to send him\\r\\n    thither,\\r\\n    For he was fitter for that place than earth.\\r\\n  ANNE. And thou unfit for any place but hell.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.\\r\\n  ANNE. Some dungeon.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Your bed-chamber.\\r\\n  ANNE. Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. So will it, madam, till I lie with you.\\r\\n  ANNE. I hope so.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,\\r\\n    To leave this keen encounter of our wits,\\r\\n    And fall something into a slower method-\\r\\n    Is not the causer of the timeless deaths\\r\\n    Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,\\r\\n    As blameful as the executioner?\\r\\n  ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs\\'d effect.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that effect-\\r\\n    Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep \\r\\n    To undertake the death of all the world\\r\\n    So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.\\r\\n  ANNE. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,\\r\\n    These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. These eyes could not endure that beauty\\'s\\r\\n    wreck;\\r\\n    You should not blemish it if I stood by.\\r\\n    As all the world is cheered by the sun,\\r\\n    So I by that; it is my day, my life.\\r\\n  ANNE. Black night o\\'ershade thy day, and death thy life!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.\\r\\n  ANNE. I would I were, to be reveng\\'d on thee.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. It is a quarrel most unnatural,\\r\\n    To be reveng\\'d on him that loveth thee.\\r\\n  ANNE. It is a quarrel just and reasonable,\\r\\n    To be reveng\\'d on him that kill\\'d my husband.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband\\r\\n    Did it to help thee to a better husband.\\r\\n  ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. He lives that loves thee better than he could. \\r\\n  ANNE. Name him.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Plantagenet.\\r\\n  ANNE. Why, that was he.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. The self-same name, but one of better nature.\\r\\n  ANNE. Where is he?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Here.  [She spits at him]  Why dost thou spit\\r\\n    at me?\\r\\n  ANNE. Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Never came poison from so sweet a place.\\r\\n  ANNE. Never hung poison on a fouler toad.\\r\\n    Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.\\r\\n  ANNE. Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I would they were, that I might die at once;\\r\\n    For now they kill me with a living death.\\r\\n    Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,\\r\\n    Sham\\'d their aspects with store of childish drops-\\r\\n    These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,\\r\\n    No, when my father York and Edward wept\\r\\n    To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made \\r\\n    When black-fac\\'d Clifford shook his sword at him;\\r\\n    Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,\\r\\n    Told the sad story of my father\\'s death,\\r\\n    And twenty times made pause to sob and weep\\r\\n    That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks\\r\\n    Like trees bedash\\'d with rain-in that sad time\\r\\n    My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;\\r\\n    And what these sorrows could not thence exhale\\r\\n    Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.\\r\\n    I never sued to friend nor enemy;\\r\\n    My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;\\r\\n    But, now thy beauty is propos\\'d my fee,\\r\\n    My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.\\r\\n                                   [She looks scornfully at him]\\r\\n    Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made\\r\\n    For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.\\r\\n    If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,\\r\\n    Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;\\r\\n    Which if thou please to hide in this true breast\\r\\n    And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, \\r\\n    I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,\\r\\n    And humbly beg the death upon my knee.\\r\\n      [He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword]\\r\\n    Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry-\\r\\n    But \\'twas thy beauty that provoked me.\\r\\n    Nay, now dispatch; \\'twas I that stabb\\'d young Edward-\\r\\n    But \\'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.\\r\\n                                           [She falls the sword]\\r\\n    Take up the sword again, or take up me.\\r\\n  ANNE. Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,\\r\\n    I will not be thy executioner.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;\\r\\n  ANNE. I have already.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. That was in thy rage.\\r\\n    Speak it again, and even with the word\\r\\n    This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,\\r\\n    Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;\\r\\n    To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.\\r\\n  ANNE. I would I knew thy heart.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. \\'Tis figur\\'d in my tongue. \\r\\n  ANNE. I fear me both are false.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Then never was man true.\\r\\n  ANNE. well put up your sword.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Say, then, my peace is made.\\r\\n  ANNE. That shalt thou know hereafter.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. But shall I live in hope?\\r\\n  ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Vouchsafe to wear this ring.\\r\\n  ANNE. To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,\\r\\n    Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;\\r\\n    Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.\\r\\n    And if thy poor devoted servant may\\r\\n    But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,\\r\\n    Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.\\r\\n  ANNE. What is it?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. That it may please you leave these sad designs\\r\\n    To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,\\r\\n    And presently repair to Crosby House;\\r\\n    Where-after I have solemnly interr\\'d \\r\\n    At Chertsey monast\\'ry this noble king,\\r\\n    And wet his grave with my repentant tears-\\r\\n    I will with all expedient duty see you.\\r\\n    For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,\\r\\n    Grant me this boon.\\r\\n  ANNE. With all my heart; and much it joys me too\\r\\n    To see you are become so penitent.\\r\\n    Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Bid me farewell.\\r\\n  ANNE. \\'Tis more than you deserve;\\r\\n    But since you teach me how to flatter you,\\r\\n    Imagine I have said farewell already.\\r\\n                             Exeunt two GENTLEMEN With LADY ANNE\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Sirs, take up the corse.\\r\\n  GENTLEMEN. Towards Chertsey, noble lord?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. No, to White Friars; there attend my coming.\\r\\n                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER\\r\\n    Was ever woman in this humour woo\\'d?\\r\\n    Was ever woman in this humour won?\\r\\n    I\\'ll have her; but I will not keep her long. \\r\\n    What! I that kill\\'d her husband and his father-\\r\\n    To take her in her heart\\'s extremest hate,\\r\\n    With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,\\r\\n    The bleeding witness of my hatred by;\\r\\n    Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,\\r\\n    And I no friends to back my suit at all\\r\\n    But the plain devil and dissembling looks,\\r\\n    And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!\\r\\n    Ha!\\r\\n    Hath she forgot already that brave prince,\\r\\n    Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,\\r\\n    Stabb\\'d in my angry mood at Tewksbury?\\r\\n    A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-\\r\\n    Fram\\'d in the prodigality of nature,\\r\\n    Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal-\\r\\n    The spacious world cannot again afford;\\r\\n    And will she yet abase her eyes on me,\\r\\n    That cropp\\'d the golden prime of this sweet prince\\r\\n    And made her widow to a woeful bed?\\r\\n    On me, whose all not equals Edward\\'s moiety? \\r\\n    On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?\\r\\n    My dukedom to a beggarly denier,\\r\\n    I do mistake my person all this while.\\r\\n    Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,\\r\\n    Myself to be a marv\\'llous proper man.\\r\\n    I\\'ll be at charges for a looking-glass,\\r\\n    And entertain a score or two of tailors\\r\\n    To study fashions to adorn my body.\\r\\n    Since I am crept in favour with myself,\\r\\n    I will maintain it with some little cost.\\r\\n    But first I\\'ll turn yon fellow in his grave,\\r\\n    And then return lamenting to my love.\\r\\n    Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,\\r\\n    That I may see my shadow as I pass.                     Exit\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. The palace\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter QUEEN ELIZABETH, LORD RIVERS, and LORD GREY\\r\\n\\r\\n  RIVERS. Have patience, madam; there\\'s no doubt his Majesty\\r\\n    Will soon recover his accustom\\'d health.\\r\\n  GREY. In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;\\r\\n    Therefore, for God\\'s sake, entertain good comfort,\\r\\n    And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. If he were dead, what would betide on\\r\\n    me?\\r\\n  GREY. No other harm but loss of such a lord.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The loss of such a lord includes all\\r\\n    harms.\\r\\n  GREY. The heavens have bless\\'d you with a goodly son\\r\\n    To be your comforter when he is gone.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, he is young; and his minority\\r\\n    Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,\\r\\n    A man that loves not me, nor none of you.\\r\\n  RIVER. Is it concluded he shall be Protector? \\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. It is determin\\'d, not concluded yet;\\r\\n    But so it must be, if the King miscarry.\\r\\n\\r\\n                     Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY\\r\\n\\r\\n  GREY. Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Good time of day unto your royal Grace!\\r\\n  DERBY. God make your Majesty joyful as you have been.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Countess Richmond, good my Lord\\r\\n    of Derby,\\r\\n    To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.\\r\\n    Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she\\'s your wife\\r\\n    And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur\\'d\\r\\n    I hate not you for her proud arrogance.\\r\\n  DERBY. I do beseech you, either not believe\\r\\n    The envious slanders of her false accusers;\\r\\n    Or, if she be accus\\'d on true report,\\r\\n    Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds\\r\\n    From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of \\r\\n    Derby?\\r\\n  DERBY. But now the Duke of Buckingham and I\\r\\n    Are come from visiting his Majesty.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What likelihood of his amendment,\\r\\n    Lords?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks\\r\\n    cheerfully.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. God grant him health! Did you confer\\r\\n    with him?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement\\r\\n    Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,\\r\\n    And between them and my Lord Chamberlain;\\r\\n    And sent to warn them to his royal presence.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Would all were well! But that will\\r\\n    never be.\\r\\n    I fear our happiness is at the height.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET\\r\\n\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. They do me wrong, and I will not endure it. \\r\\n    Who is it that complains unto the King\\r\\n    That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?\\r\\n    By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly\\r\\n    That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.\\r\\n    Because I cannot flatter and look fair,\\r\\n    Smile in men\\'s faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,\\r\\n    Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,\\r\\n    I must be held a rancorous enemy.\\r\\n    Cannot a plain man live and think no harm\\r\\n    But thus his simple truth must be abus\\'d\\r\\n    With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?\\r\\n  GREY. To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.\\r\\n    When have I injur\\'d thee? when done thee wrong,\\r\\n    Or thee, or thee, or any of your faction?\\r\\n    A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-\\r\\n    Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-\\r\\n    Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while\\r\\n    But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the \\r\\n    matter.\\r\\n    The King, on his own royal disposition\\r\\n    And not provok\\'d by any suitor else-\\r\\n    Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred\\r\\n    That in your outward action shows itself\\r\\n    Against my children, brothers, and myself-\\r\\n    Makes him to send that he may learn the ground.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad\\r\\n    That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.\\r\\n    Since every Jack became a gentleman,\\r\\n    There\\'s many a gentle person made a Jack.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, we know your meaning,\\r\\n    brother Gloucester:\\r\\n    You envy my advancement and my friends\\';\\r\\n    God grant we never may have need of you!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Meantime, God grants that I have need of you.\\r\\n    Our brother is imprison\\'d by your means,\\r\\n    Myself disgrac\\'d, and the nobility\\r\\n    Held in contempt; while great promotions\\r\\n    Are daily given to ennoble those \\r\\n    That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. By Him that rais\\'d me to this careful\\r\\n    height\\r\\n    From that contented hap which I enjoy\\'d,\\r\\n    I never did incense his Majesty\\r\\n    Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been\\r\\n    An earnest advocate to plead for him.\\r\\n    My lord, you do me shameful injury\\r\\n    Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. You may deny that you were not the mean\\r\\n    Of my Lord Hastings\\' late imprisonment.\\r\\n  RIVERS. She may, my lord; for-\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows\\r\\n    not so?\\r\\n    She may do more, sir, than denying that:\\r\\n    She may help you to many fair preferments\\r\\n    And then deny her aiding hand therein,\\r\\n    And lay those honours on your high desert.\\r\\n    What may she not? She may-ay, marry, may she-\\r\\n  RIVERS. What, marry, may she? \\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,\\r\\n    A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.\\r\\n    Iwis your grandam had a worser match.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long\\r\\n    borne\\r\\n    Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.\\r\\n    By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty\\r\\n    Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur\\'d.\\r\\n    I had rather be a country servant-maid\\r\\n    Than a great queen with this condition-\\r\\n    To be so baited, scorn\\'d, and stormed at.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter old QUEEN MARGARET, behind\\r\\n\\r\\n    Small joy have I in being England\\'s Queen.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. And less\\'ned be that small, God, I\\r\\n    beseech Him!\\r\\n    Thy honour, state, and seat, is due to me.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. What! Threat you me with telling of the\\r\\n    King? \\r\\n    Tell him and spare not. Look what I have said\\r\\n    I will avouch\\'t in presence of the King.\\r\\n    I dare adventure to be sent to th\\' Tow\\'r.\\r\\n    \\'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Out, devil! I do remember them to\\r\\n    well:\\r\\n    Thou kill\\'dst my husband Henry in the Tower,\\r\\n    And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband\\r\\n    King,\\r\\n    I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,\\r\\n    A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,\\r\\n    A liberal rewarder of his friends;\\r\\n    To royalize his blood I spent mine own.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, and much better blood than his or\\r\\n    thine.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. In all which time you and your husband Grey\\r\\n    Were factious for the house of Lancaster;\\r\\n    And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband\\r\\n    In Margaret\\'s battle at Saint Albans slain? \\r\\n    Let me put in your minds, if you forget,\\r\\n    What you have been ere this, and what you are;\\r\\n    Withal, what I have been, and what I am.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. A murd\\'rous villain, and so still thou art.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,\\r\\n    Ay, and forswore himself-which Jesu pardon!-\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Which God revenge!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. To fight on Edward\\'s party for the crown;\\r\\n    And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.\\r\\n    I would to God my heart were flint like Edward\\'s,\\r\\n    Or Edward\\'s soft and pitiful like mine.\\r\\n    I am too childish-foolish for this world.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this\\r\\n    world,\\r\\n    Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is.\\r\\n  RIVERS. My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days\\r\\n    Which here you urge to prove us enemies,\\r\\n    We follow\\'d then our lord, our sovereign king.\\r\\n    So should we you, if you should be our king.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar. \\r\\n    Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As little joy, my lord, as you suppose\\r\\n    You should enjoy were you this country\\'s king,\\r\\n    As little joy you may suppose in me\\r\\n    That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof;\\r\\n    For I am she, and altogether joyless.\\r\\n    I can no longer hold me patient.                 [Advancing]\\r\\n    Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out\\r\\n    In sharing that which you have pill\\'d from me.\\r\\n    Which of you trembles not that looks on me?\\r\\n    If not that, I am Queen, you bow like subjects,\\r\\n    Yet that, by you depos\\'d, you quake like rebels?\\r\\n    Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Foul wrinkled witch, what mak\\'st thou in my\\r\\n    sight?\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. But repetition of what thou hast marr\\'d,\\r\\n    That will I make before I let thee go.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Wert thou not banished on pain of death?\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. I was; but I do find more pain in \\r\\n    banishment\\r\\n    Than death can yield me here by my abode.\\r\\n    A husband and a son thou ow\\'st to me;\\r\\n    And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance.\\r\\n    This sorrow that I have by right is yours;\\r\\n    And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. The curse my noble father laid on thee,\\r\\n    When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper\\r\\n    And with thy scorns drew\\'st rivers from his eyes,\\r\\n    And then to dry them gav\\'st the Duke a clout\\r\\n    Steep\\'d in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland-\\r\\n    His curses then from bitterness of soul\\r\\n    Denounc\\'d against thee are all fall\\'n upon thee;\\r\\n    And God, not we, hath plagu\\'d thy bloody deed.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. So just is God to right the innocent.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. O, \\'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,\\r\\n    And the most merciless that e\\'er was heard of!\\r\\n  RIVERS. Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.\\r\\n  DORSET. No man but prophesied revenge for it.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Northumberland, then present, wept to see it. \\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. What, were you snarling all before I came,\\r\\n    Ready to catch each other by the throat,\\r\\n    And turn you all your hatred now on me?\\r\\n    Did York\\'s dread curse prevail so much with heaven\\r\\n    That Henry\\'s death, my lovely Edward\\'s death,\\r\\n    Their kingdom\\'s loss, my woeful banishment,\\r\\n    Should all but answer for that peevish brat?\\r\\n    Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?\\r\\n    Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!\\r\\n    Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,\\r\\n    As ours by murder, to make him a king!\\r\\n    Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,\\r\\n    For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,\\r\\n    Die in his youth by like untimely violence!\\r\\n    Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,\\r\\n    Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!\\r\\n    Long mayest thou live to wail thy children\\'s death,\\r\\n    And see another, as I see thee now,\\r\\n    Deck\\'d in thy rights, as thou art stall\\'d in mine!\\r\\n    Long die thy happy days before thy death; \\r\\n    And, after many length\\'ned hours of grief,\\r\\n    Die neither mother, wife, nor England\\'s Queen!\\r\\n    Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,\\r\\n    And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son\\r\\n    Was stabb\\'d with bloody daggers. God, I pray him,\\r\\n    That none of you may live his natural age,\\r\\n    But by some unlook\\'d accident cut off!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither\\'d\\r\\n    hag.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou\\r\\n    shalt hear me.\\r\\n    If heaven have any grievous plague in store\\r\\n    Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,\\r\\n    O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,\\r\\n    And then hurl down their indignation\\r\\n    On thee, the troubler of the poor world\\'s peace!\\r\\n    The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul!\\r\\n    Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv\\'st,\\r\\n    And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!\\r\\n    No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine, \\r\\n    Unless it be while some tormenting dream\\r\\n    Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!\\r\\n    Thou elvish-mark\\'d, abortive, rooting hog,\\r\\n    Thou that wast seal\\'d in thy nativity\\r\\n    The slave of nature and the son of hell,\\r\\n    Thou slander of thy heavy mother\\'s womb,\\r\\n    Thou loathed issue of thy father\\'s loins,\\r\\n    Thou rag of honour, thou detested-\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Margaret!\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Richard!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Ha?\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. I call thee not.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I cry thee mercy then, for I did think\\r\\n    That thou hadst call\\'d me all these bitter names.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Why, so I did, but look\\'d for no reply.\\r\\n    O, let me make the period to my curse!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. \\'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thus have you breath\\'d your curse\\r\\n    against yourself.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my \\r\\n    fortune!\\r\\n    Why strew\\'st thou sugar on that bottled spider\\r\\n    Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?\\r\\n    Fool, fool! thou whet\\'st a knife to kill thyself.\\r\\n    The day will come that thou shalt wish for me\\r\\n    To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back\\'d toad.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,\\r\\n    Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Foul shame upon you! you have all\\r\\n    mov\\'d mine.\\r\\n  RIVERS. Were you well serv\\'d, you would be taught your\\r\\n      duty.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. To serve me well you all should do me\\r\\n    duty,\\r\\n    Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects.\\r\\n    O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!\\r\\n  DORSET. Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Peace, Master Marquis, you are malapert;\\r\\n    Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.\\r\\n    O, that your young nobility could judge \\r\\n    What \\'twere to lose it and be miserable!\\r\\n    They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,\\r\\n    And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Good counsel, marry; learn it, learn it, Marquis.\\r\\n  DORSET. It touches you, my lord, as much as me.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Ay, and much more; but I was born so high,\\r\\n    Our aery buildeth in the cedar\\'s top,\\r\\n    And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas!\\r\\n    Witness my son, now in the shade of death,\\r\\n    Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath\\r\\n    Hath in eternal darkness folded up.\\r\\n    Your aery buildeth in our aery\\'s nest.\\r\\n    O God that seest it, do not suffer it;\\r\\n    As it is won with blood, lost be it so!\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity!\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Urge neither charity nor shame to me.\\r\\n    Uncharitably with me have you dealt,\\r\\n    And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher\\'d.\\r\\n    My charity is outrage, life my shame; \\r\\n    And in that shame still live my sorrow\\'s rage!\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Have done, have done.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. O princely Buckingham, I\\'ll kiss thy\\r\\n    hand\\r\\n    In sign of league and amity with thee.\\r\\n    Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!\\r\\n    Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,\\r\\n    Nor thou within the compass of my curse.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Nor no one here; for curses never pass\\r\\n    The lips of those that breathe them in the air.\\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. I will not think but they ascend the sky\\r\\n    And there awake God\\'s gentle-sleeping peace.\\r\\n    O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!\\r\\n    Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,\\r\\n    His venom tooth will rankle to the death:\\r\\n    Have not to do with him, beware of him;\\r\\n    Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,\\r\\n    And all their ministers attend on him.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord. \\r\\n  QUEEN MARGARET. What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle\\r\\n    counsel,\\r\\n    And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?\\r\\n    O, but remember this another day,\\r\\n    When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,\\r\\n    And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!\\r\\n    Live each of you the subjects to his hate,\\r\\n    And he to yours, and all of you to God\\'s!               Exit\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.\\r\\n  RIVERS. And so doth mine. I muse why she\\'s at liberty.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I cannot blame her; by God\\'s holy Mother,\\r\\n    She hath had too much wrong; and I repent\\r\\n    My part thereof that I have done to her.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I never did her any to my knowledge.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.\\r\\n    I was too hot to do somebody good\\r\\n    That is too cold in thinking of it now.\\r\\n    Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;\\r\\n    He is frank\\'d up to fatting for his pains;\\r\\n    God pardon them that are the cause thereof! \\r\\n  RIVERS. A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,\\r\\n    To pray for them that have done scathe to us!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. So do I ever-  [Aside]  being well advis\\'d;\\r\\n    For had I curs\\'d now, I had curs\\'d myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Enter CATESBY\\r\\n\\r\\n  CATESBY. Madam, his Majesty doth can for you,\\r\\n    And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go\\r\\n    with me?\\r\\n  RIVERS. We wait upon your Grace.\\r\\n                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.\\r\\n    The secret mischiefs that I set abroach\\r\\n    I lay unto the grievous charge of others.\\r\\n    Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,\\r\\n    I do beweep to many simple gulls;\\r\\n    Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham;\\r\\n    And tell them \\'tis the Queen and her allies \\r\\n    That stir the King against the Duke my brother.\\r\\n    Now they believe it, and withal whet me\\r\\n    To be reveng\\'d on Rivers, Dorset, Grey;\\r\\n    But then I sigh and, with a piece of Scripture,\\r\\n    Tell them that God bids us do good for evil.\\r\\n    And thus I clothe my naked villainy\\r\\n    With odd old ends stol\\'n forth of holy writ,\\r\\n    And seem a saint when most I play the devil.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter two MURDERERS\\r\\n\\r\\n    But, soft, here come my executioners.\\r\\n    How now, my hardy stout resolved mates!\\r\\n    Are you now going to dispatch this thing?\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. We are, my lord, and come to have the\\r\\n    warrant,\\r\\n    That we may be admitted where he is.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Well thought upon; I have it here about me.\\r\\n                                             [Gives the warrant]\\r\\n    When you have done, repair to Crosby Place. \\r\\n    But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,\\r\\n    Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;\\r\\n    For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps\\r\\n    May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to\\r\\n    prate;\\r\\n    Talkers are no good doers. Be assur\\'d\\r\\n    We go to use our hands and not our tongues.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Your eyes drop millstones when fools\\' eyes fall\\r\\n    tears.\\r\\n    I like you, lads; about your business straight;\\r\\n    Go, go, dispatch.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. We will, my noble lord.                 Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. The Tower\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter CLARENCE and KEEPER\\r\\n\\r\\n  KEEPER. Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?\\r\\n  CLARENCE. O, I have pass\\'d a miserable night,\\r\\n    So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,\\r\\n    That, as I am a Christian faithful man,\\r\\n    I would not spend another such a night\\r\\n    Though \\'twere to buy a world of happy days-\\r\\n    So full of dismal terror was the time!\\r\\n  KEEPER. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you\\r\\n    tell me.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower\\r\\n    And was embark\\'d to cross to Burgundy;\\r\\n    And in my company my brother Gloucester,\\r\\n    Who from my cabin tempted me to walk\\r\\n    Upon the hatches. Thence we look\\'d toward England,\\r\\n    And cited up a thousand heavy times,\\r\\n    During the wars of York and Lancaster,\\r\\n    That had befall\\'n us. As we pac\\'d along \\r\\n    Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,\\r\\n    Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling\\r\\n    Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard\\r\\n    Into the tumbling billows of the main.\\r\\n    O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,\\r\\n    What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,\\r\\n    What sights of ugly death within my eyes!\\r\\n    Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,\\r\\n    A thousand men that fishes gnaw\\'d upon,\\r\\n    Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\\r\\n    Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,\\r\\n    All scatt\\'red in the bottom of the sea;\\r\\n    Some lay in dead men\\'s skulls, and in the holes\\r\\n    Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,\\r\\n    As \\'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,\\r\\n    That woo\\'d the slimy bottom of the deep\\r\\n    And mock\\'d the dead bones that lay scatt\\'red by.\\r\\n  KEEPER. Had you such leisure in the time of death\\r\\n    To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Methought I had; and often did I strive \\r\\n    To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood\\r\\n    Stopp\\'d in my soul and would not let it forth\\r\\n    To find the empty, vast, and wand\\'ring air;\\r\\n    But smother\\'d it within my panting bulk,\\r\\n    Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.\\r\\n  KEEPER. Awak\\'d you not in this sore agony?\\r\\n  CLARENCE. No, no, my dream was lengthen\\'d after life.\\r\\n    O, then began the tempest to my soul!\\r\\n    I pass\\'d, methought, the melancholy flood\\r\\n    With that sour ferryman which poets write of,\\r\\n    Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.\\r\\n    The first that there did greet my stranger soul\\r\\n    Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,\\r\\n    Who spake aloud \\'What scourge for perjury\\r\\n    Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?\\'\\r\\n    And so he vanish\\'d. Then came wand\\'ring by\\r\\n    A shadow like an angel, with bright hair\\r\\n    Dabbled in blood, and he shriek\\'d out aloud\\r\\n    \\'Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur\\'d Clarence,\\r\\n    That stabb\\'d me in the field by Tewksbury. \\r\\n    Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!\\'\\r\\n    With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends\\r\\n    Environ\\'d me, and howled in mine ears\\r\\n    Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,\\r\\n    I trembling wak\\'d, and for a season after\\r\\n    Could not believe but that I was in hell,\\r\\n    Such terrible impression made my dream.\\r\\n  KEEPER. No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;\\r\\n    I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things\\r\\n    That now give evidence against my soul\\r\\n    For Edward\\'s sake, and see how he requites me!\\r\\n    O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,\\r\\n    But Thou wilt be aveng\\'d on my misdeeds,\\r\\n    Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone;\\r\\n    O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!\\r\\n  KEEPER, I prithee sit by me awhile;\\r\\n    My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.\\r\\n  KEEPER. I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.\\r\\n                                               [CLARENCE sleeps] \\r\\n\\r\\n                  Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant\\r\\n\\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,\\r\\n    Makes the night morning and the noontide night.\\r\\n    Princes have but their titles for their glories,\\r\\n    An outward honour for an inward toil;\\r\\n    And for unfelt imaginations\\r\\n    They often feel a world of restless cares,\\r\\n    So that between their tides and low name\\r\\n    There\\'s nothing differs but the outward fame.\\r\\n\\r\\n                      Enter the two MURDERERS\\r\\n\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Ho! who\\'s here?\\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam\\'st\\r\\n    thou hither?\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. I would speak with Clarence, and I came\\r\\n    hither on my legs.\\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. What, so brief? \\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. \\'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let\\r\\n    him see our commission and talk no more.\\r\\n                                           [BRAKENBURY reads it]\\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. I am, in this, commanded to deliver\\r\\n    The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.\\r\\n    I will not reason what is meant hereby,\\r\\n    Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.\\r\\n    There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.\\r\\n    I\\'ll to the King and signify to him\\r\\n    That thus I have resign\\'d to you my charge.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. You may, sir; \\'tis a point of wisdom. Fare\\r\\n    you well.                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. No; he\\'ll say \\'twas done cowardly, when\\r\\n    he wakes.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shall never wake until the great\\r\\n    judgment-day.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Why, then he\\'ll say we stabb\\'d him\\r\\n    sleeping.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath \\r\\n    bred a kind of remorse in me.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. What, art thou afraid?\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to\\r\\n    be damn\\'d for killing him, from the which no warrant can\\r\\n    defend me.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. I thought thou hadst been resolute.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. So I am, to let him live.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. I\\'ll back to the Duke of Gloucester and\\r\\n    tell him so.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this\\r\\n    passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to\\r\\n    hold me but while one tells twenty.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. How dost thou feel thyself now?\\r\\n    SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience\\r\\n    are yet within me.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed\\'s\\r\\n    done.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Where\\'s thy conscience now?\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester\\'s purse! \\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. When he opens his purse to give us our\\r\\n    reward, thy conscience flies out.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. \\'Tis no matter; let it go; there\\'s few or\\r\\n    none will entertain it.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. What if it come to thee again?\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. I\\'ll not meddle with it-it makes a man\\r\\n    coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man\\r\\n    cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his\\r\\n    neighbour\\'s wife, but it detects him. \\'Tis a blushing shame-\\r\\n    fac\\'d spirit that mutinies in a man\\'s bosom; it fills a man\\r\\n    full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold\\r\\n    that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.\\r\\n    It is turn\\'d out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;\\r\\n    and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust\\r\\n    to himself and live without it.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Zounds, \\'tis even now at my elbow,\\r\\n    persuading me not to kill the Duke.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe\\r\\n    him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the\\r\\n    sigh. \\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. I am strong-fram\\'d; he cannot prevail with\\r\\n    me.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Spoke like a tall man that respects thy\\r\\n    reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of\\r\\n    thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the\\r\\n    next room.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. O excellent device! and make a sop of\\r\\n    him.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Soft! he wakes.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Strike!\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. No, we\\'ll reason with him.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. You shall have wine enough, my lord,\\r\\n    anon.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. In God\\'s name, what art thou?\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. A man, as you are.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. But not as I am, royal.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Nor you as we are, loyal.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble. \\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King\\'s, my looks\\r\\n    mine own.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!\\r\\n    Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?\\r\\n    Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. To, to, to-\\r\\n  CLARENCE. To murder me?\\r\\n  BOTH MURDERERS. Ay, ay.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,\\r\\n    And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.\\r\\n    Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Offended us you have not, but the King.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. I shall be reconcil\\'d to him again.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Are you drawn forth among a world of men\\r\\n    To slay the innocent? What is my offence?\\r\\n    Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?\\r\\n    What lawful quest have given their verdict up\\r\\n    Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc\\'d\\r\\n    The bitter sentence of poor Clarence\\' death? \\r\\n    Before I be convict by course of law,\\r\\n    To threaten me with death is most unlawful.\\r\\n    I charge you, as you hope to have redemption\\r\\n    By Christ\\'s dear blood shed for our grievous sins,\\r\\n    That you depart and lay no hands on me.\\r\\n    The deed you undertake is damnable.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. What we will do, we do upon command.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. And he that hath commanded is our\\r\\n    King.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings\\r\\n    Hath in the tables of his law commanded\\r\\n    That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then\\r\\n    Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man\\'s?\\r\\n    Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand\\r\\n    To hurl upon their heads that break his law.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. And that same vengeance doth he hurl\\r\\n    on thee\\r\\n    For false forswearing, and for murder too;\\r\\n    Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight\\r\\n    In quarrel of the house of Lancaster. \\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. And like a traitor to the name of God\\r\\n    Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade\\r\\n    Unripp\\'dst the bowels of thy sov\\'reign\\'s son.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and\\r\\n    defend.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. How canst thou urge God\\'s dreadful law\\r\\n    to us,\\r\\n    When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?\\r\\n    For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.\\r\\n    He sends you not to murder me for this,\\r\\n    For in that sin he is as deep as I.\\r\\n    If God will be avenged for the deed,\\r\\n    O, know you yet He doth it publicly.\\r\\n    Take not the quarrel from His pow\\'rful arm;\\r\\n    He needs no indirect or lawless course\\r\\n    To cut off those that have offended Him.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Who made thee then a bloody minister\\r\\n    When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,\\r\\n    That princely novice, was struck dead by thee? \\r\\n  CLARENCE. My brother\\'s love, the devil, and my rage.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Thy brother\\'s love, our duty, and thy\\r\\n    faults,\\r\\n    Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. If you do love my brother, hate not me;\\r\\n    I am his brother, and I love him well.\\r\\n    If you are hir\\'d for meed, go back again,\\r\\n    And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,\\r\\n    Who shall reward you better for my life\\r\\n    Than Edward will for tidings of my death.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. You are deceiv\\'d: your brother Gloucester\\r\\n    hates you.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.\\r\\n    Go you to him from me.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, so we will.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Tell him when that our princely father York\\r\\n    Bless\\'d his three sons with his victorious arm\\r\\n    And charg\\'d us from his soul to love each other,\\r\\n    He little thought of this divided friendship.\\r\\n    Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep. \\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, millstones; as he lesson\\'d us to weep.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. O, do not slander him, for he is kind.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you\\r\\n    deceive yourself:\\r\\n    \\'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.\\r\\n    CLARENCE. It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune\\r\\n    And hugg\\'d me in his arms, and swore with sobs\\r\\n    That he would labour my delivery.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Why, so he doth, when he delivers you\\r\\n    From this earth\\'s thraldom to the joys of heaven.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Make peace with God, for you must die,\\r\\n    my lord.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Have you that holy feeling in your souls\\r\\n    To counsel me to make my peace with God,\\r\\n    And are you yet to your own souls so blind\\r\\n    That you will war with God by murd\\'ring me?\\r\\n    O, sirs, consider: they that set you on\\r\\n    To do this deed will hate you for the deed.\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. What shall we do?\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Relent, and save your souls. \\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. Relent! No, \\'tis cowardly and womanish.\\r\\n  CLARENCE. Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.\\r\\n    Which of you, if you were a prince\\'s son,\\r\\n    Being pent from liberty as I am now,\\r\\n    If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,\\r\\n    Would not entreat for life?\\r\\n    My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks;\\r\\n    O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,\\r\\n    Come thou on my side and entreat for me-\\r\\n    As you would beg were you in my distress.\\r\\n    A begging prince what beggar pities not?\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. Look behind you, my lord.\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER.  [Stabbing him]  Take that, and that. If all\\r\\n    this will not do,\\r\\n    I\\'ll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.\\r\\n                                              Exit with the body\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. A bloody deed, and desperately\\r\\n    dispatch\\'d!\\r\\n    How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands\\r\\n    Of this most grievous murder! \\r\\n\\r\\n                       Re-enter FIRST MURDERER\\r\\n\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER-How now, what mean\\'st thou that thou\\r\\n    help\\'st me not?\\r\\n    By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have\\r\\n    been!\\r\\n  SECOND MURDERER. I would he knew that I had sav\\'d his\\r\\n    brother!\\r\\n    Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;\\r\\n    For I repent me that the Duke is slain.                 Exit\\r\\n  FIRST MURDERER. So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.\\r\\n    Well, I\\'ll go hide the body in some hole,\\r\\n    Till that the Duke give order for his burial;\\r\\n    And when I have my meed, I will away;\\r\\n    For this will out, and then I must not stay.

The palace\\r\\n\\r\\nFlourish. Enter KING EDWARD sick, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DORSET,\\r\\nRIVERS,\\r\\nHASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others\\r\\n\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. Why, so. Now have I done a good day\\'s\\r\\n    work.\\r\\n    You peers, continue this united league.\\r\\n    I every day expect an embassage\\r\\n    From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;\\r\\n    And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven,\\r\\n    Since I have made my friends at peace on earth.\\r\\n    Hastings and Rivers, take each other\\'s hand;\\r\\n    Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.\\r\\n  RIVERS. By heaven, my soul is purg\\'d from grudging hate;\\r\\n    And with my hand I seal my true heart\\'s love.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. Take heed you dally not before your king;\\r\\n    Lest He that is the supreme King of kings\\r\\n    Confound your hidden falsehood and award \\r\\n    Either of you to be the other\\'s end.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!\\r\\n  RIVERS. And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;\\r\\n    Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you:\\r\\n    You have been factious one against the other.\\r\\n    Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;\\r\\n    And what you do, do it unfeignedly.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. There, Hastings; I will never more\\r\\n    remember\\r\\n    Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord\\r\\n    Marquis.\\r\\n  DORSET. This interchange of love, I here protest,\\r\\n    Upon my part shall be inviolable.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. And so swear I.                       [They embrace]\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this\\r\\n    league\\r\\n    With thy embracements to my wife\\'s allies,\\r\\n    And make me happy in your unity. \\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM.  [To the QUEEN]  Whenever Buckingham\\r\\n    doth turn his hate\\r\\n    Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love\\r\\n    Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me\\r\\n    With hate in those where I expect most love!\\r\\n    When I have most need to employ a friend\\r\\n    And most assured that he is a friend,\\r\\n    Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,\\r\\n    Be he unto me! This do I beg of God\\r\\n    When I am cold in love to you or yours.\\r\\n                                                  [They embrace]\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,\\r\\n    Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.\\r\\n    There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here\\r\\n    To make the blessed period of this peace.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time,\\r\\n    Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke.\\r\\n\\r\\n                      Enter GLOUCESTER, and RATCLIFF\\r\\n \\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Good morrow to my sovereign king and\\r\\n    Queen;\\r\\n    And, princely peers, a happy time of day!\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.\\r\\n    Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,\\r\\n    Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,\\r\\n    Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.\\r\\n    Among this princely heap, if any here,\\r\\n    By false intelligence or wrong surmise,\\r\\n    Hold me a foe-\\r\\n    If I unwittingly, or in my rage,\\r\\n    Have aught committed that is hardly borne\\r\\n    To any in this presence, I desire\\r\\n    To reconcile me to his friendly peace:\\r\\n    \\'Tis death to me to be at enmity;\\r\\n    I hate it, and desire all good men\\'s love.\\r\\n    First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,\\r\\n    Which I will purchase with my duteous service;\\r\\n    Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham, \\r\\n    If ever any grudge were lodg\\'d between us;\\r\\n    Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,\\r\\n    That all without desert have frown\\'d on me;\\r\\n    Of you, Lord Woodville, and, Lord Scales, of you;\\r\\n    Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen-indeed, of all.\\r\\n    I do not know that Englishman alive\\r\\n    With whom my soul is any jot at odds\\r\\n    More than the infant that is born to-night.\\r\\n    I thank my God for my humility.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.\\r\\n    I would to God all strifes were well compounded.\\r\\n    My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness\\r\\n    To take our brother Clarence to your grace.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Why, madam, have I off\\'red love for this,\\r\\n    To be so flouted in this royal presence?\\r\\n    Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead?\\r\\n                                                [They all start]\\r\\n    You do him injury to scorn his corse.\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. Who knows not he is dead! Who knows\\r\\n    he is? \\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?\\r\\n  DORSET. Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence\\r\\n    But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. Is Clarence dead? The order was revers\\'d.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. But he, poor man, by your first order died,\\r\\n    And that a winged Mercury did bear;\\r\\n    Some tardy cripple bare the countermand\\r\\n    That came too lag to see him buried.\\r\\n    God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,\\r\\n    Nearer in bloody thoughts, an not in blood,\\r\\n    Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,\\r\\n    And yet go current from suspicion!\\r\\n\\r\\n                           Enter DERBY\\r\\n\\r\\n  DERBY. A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. I prithee, peace; my soul is full of sorrow.\\r\\n  DERBY. I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me.\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. Then say at once what is it thou requests. \\r\\n  DERBY. The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant\\'s life;\\r\\n    Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman\\r\\n    Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.\\r\\n  KING EDWARD. Have I a tongue to doom my brother\\'s death,\\r\\n    And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?\\r\\n    My brother killed no man-his fault was thought,\\r\\n    And yet his punishment was bitter death.\\r\\n    Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,\\r\\n    Kneel\\'d at my feet, and bid me be advis\\'d?\\r\\n    Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?\\r\\n    Who told me how the poor soul did forsake\\r\\n    The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?\\r\\n    Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury\\r\\n    When Oxford had me down, he rescued me\\r\\n    And said \\'Dear Brother, live, and be a king\\'?\\r\\n    Who told me, when we both lay in the field\\r\\n    Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me\\r\\n    Even in his garments, and did give himself,\\r\\n    All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?\\r\\n    All this from my remembrance brutish wrath \\r\\n    Sinfully pluck\\'d, and not a man of you\\r\\n    Had so much race to put it in my mind.\\r\\n    But when your carters or your waiting-vassals\\r\\n    Have done a drunken slaughter and defac\\'d\\r\\n    The precious image of our dear Redeemer,\\r\\n    You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;\\r\\n    And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.        [DERBY rises]\\r\\n    But for my brother not a man would speak;\\r\\n    Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself\\r\\n    For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all\\r\\n    Have been beholding to him in his life;\\r\\n    Yet none of you would once beg for his life.\\r\\n    O God, I fear thy justice will take hold\\r\\n    On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this!\\r\\n    Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Ah, poor Clarence!\\r\\n                                 Exeunt some with KING and QUEEN\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. This is the fruits of rashness. Mark\\'d you not\\r\\n    How that the guilty kindred of the Queen\\r\\n    Look\\'d pale when they did hear of Clarence\\' death?\\r\\n    O, they did urge it still unto the King! \\r\\n    God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go\\r\\n    To comfort Edward with our company?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. We wait upon your Grace.                    Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. The palace\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter the old DUCHESS OF YORK, with the SON and DAUGHTER of\\r\\nCLARENCE\\r\\n\\r\\n  SON. Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?\\r\\n  DUCHESS. No, boy.\\r\\n  DAUGHTER. Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,\\r\\n    And cry \\'O Clarence, my unhappy son!\\'?\\r\\n  SON. Why do you look on us, and shake your head,\\r\\n    And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,\\r\\n    If that our noble father were alive?\\r\\n  DUCHESS. My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;\\r\\n    I do lament the sickness of the King,\\r\\n    As loath to lose him, not your father\\'s death;\\r\\n    It were lost sorrow to wail one that\\'s lost.\\r\\n  SON. Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.\\r\\n    The King mine uncle is to blame for it.\\r\\n    God will revenge it; whom I will importune\\r\\n    With earnest prayers all to that effect.\\r\\n  DAUGHTER. And so will I. \\r\\n  DUCHESS. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you\\r\\n    well.\\r\\n    Incapable and shallow innocents,\\r\\n    You cannot guess who caus\\'d your father\\'s death.\\r\\n  SON. Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester\\r\\n    Told me the King, provok\\'d to it by the Queen,\\r\\n    Devis\\'d impeachments to imprison him.\\r\\n    And when my uncle told me so, he wept,\\r\\n    And pitied me, and kindly kiss\\'d my cheek;\\r\\n    Bade me rely on him as on my father,\\r\\n    And he would love me dearly as a child.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,\\r\\n    And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice!\\r\\n    He is my son; ay, and therein my shame;\\r\\n    Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.\\r\\n  SON. Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?\\r\\n  DUCHESS. Ay, boy.\\r\\n  SON. I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n            Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her \\r\\n                ears; RIVERS and DORSET after her\\r\\n\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and\\r\\n    weep,\\r\\n    To chide my fortune, and torment myself?\\r\\n    I\\'ll join with black despair against my soul\\r\\n    And to myself become an enemy.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. What means this scene of rude impatience?\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To make an act of tragic violence.\\r\\n  EDWARD, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.\\r\\n    Why grow the branches when the root is gone?\\r\\n    Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?\\r\\n    If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,\\r\\n    That our swift-winged souls may catch the King\\'s,\\r\\n    Or like obedient subjects follow him\\r\\n    To his new kingdom of ne\\'er-changing night.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow\\r\\n    As I had title in thy noble husband!\\r\\n    I have bewept a worthy husband\\'s death,\\r\\n    And liv\\'d with looking on his images; \\r\\n    But now two mirrors of his princely semblance\\r\\n    Are crack\\'d in pieces by malignant death,\\r\\n    And I for comfort have but one false glass,\\r\\n    That grieves me when I see my shame in him.\\r\\n    Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother\\r\\n    And hast the comfort of thy children left;\\r\\n    But death hath snatch\\'d my husband from mine arms\\r\\n    And pluck\\'d two crutches from my feeble hands-\\r\\n    Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I-\\r\\n    Thine being but a moiety of my moan-\\r\\n    To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries?\\r\\n  SON. Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father\\'s death!\\r\\n    How can we aid you with our kindred tears?\\r\\n  DAUGHTER. Our fatherless distress was left unmoan\\'d;\\r\\n    Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Give me no help in lamentation;\\r\\n    I am not barren to bring forth complaints.\\r\\n    All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes\\r\\n    That I, being govern\\'d by the watery moon,\\r\\n    May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world! \\r\\n    Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!\\r\\n  CHILDREN. Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!\\r\\n  DUCHESS. Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What stay had I but Edward? and he\\'s\\r\\n    gone.\\r\\n  CHILDREN. What stay had we but Clarence? and he\\'s gone.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. What stays had I but they? and they are gone.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Was never widow had so dear a loss.\\r\\n  CHILDREN. Were never orphans had so dear a loss.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. Was never mother had so dear a loss.\\r\\n    Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!\\r\\n    Their woes are parcell\\'d, mine is general.\\r\\n    She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:\\r\\n    I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she.\\r\\n    These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I:\\r\\n    I for an Edward weep, so do not they.\\r\\n    Alas, you three on me, threefold distress\\'d,\\r\\n    Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow\\'s nurse,\\r\\n    And I will pamper it with lamentation.\\r\\n  DORSET. Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas\\'d \\r\\n    That you take with unthankfulness his doing.\\r\\n    In common worldly things \\'tis called ungrateful\\r\\n    With dull unwillingness to repay a debt\\r\\n    Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;\\r\\n    Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,\\r\\n    For it requires the royal debt it lent you.\\r\\n  RIVERS. Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,\\r\\n    Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him;\\r\\n    Let him be crown\\'d; in him your comfort lives.\\r\\n    Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward\\'s grave,\\r\\n    And plant your joys in living Edward\\'s throne.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY,\\r\\n                      HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF\\r\\n\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause\\r\\n    To wail the dimming of our shining star;\\r\\n    But none can help our harms by wailing them.\\r\\n    Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;\\r\\n    I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee \\r\\n    I crave your blessing.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. God bless thee; and put meekness in thy breast,\\r\\n    Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Amen!  [Aside]  And make me die a good old\\r\\n    man!\\r\\n    That is the butt end of a mother\\'s blessing;\\r\\n    I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing\\r\\n    peers,\\r\\n    That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,\\r\\n    Now cheer each other in each other\\'s love.\\r\\n    Though we have spent our harvest of this king,\\r\\n    We are to reap the harvest of his son.\\r\\n    The broken rancour of your high-swol\\'n hearts,\\r\\n    But lately splinter\\'d, knit, and join\\'d together,\\r\\n    Must gently be preserv\\'d, cherish\\'d, and kept.\\r\\n    Me seemeth good that, with some little train,\\r\\n    Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet\\r\\n    Hither to London, to be crown\\'d our King.\\r\\n\\r\\n RIVERS. Why with some little train, my Lord of \\r\\n    Buckingham?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude\\r\\n    The new-heal\\'d wound of malice should break out,\\r\\n    Which would be so much the more dangerous\\r\\n    By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern\\'d;\\r\\n    Where every horse bears his commanding rein\\r\\n    And may direct his course as please himself,\\r\\n    As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,\\r\\n    In my opinion, ought to be prevented.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I hope the King made peace with all of us;\\r\\n    And the compact is firm and true in me.\\r\\n  RIVERS. And so in me; and so, I think, in an.\\r\\n    Yet, since it is but green, it should be put\\r\\n    To no apparent likelihood of breach,\\r\\n    Which haply by much company might be urg\\'d;\\r\\n    Therefore I say with noble Buckingham\\r\\n    That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. And so say I.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Then be it so; and go we to determine\\r\\n    Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow. \\r\\n    Madam, and you, my sister, will you go\\r\\n    To give your censures in this business?\\r\\n                        Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,\\r\\n    For God sake, let not us two stay at home;\\r\\n    For by the way I\\'ll sort occasion,\\r\\n    As index to the story we late talk\\'d of,\\r\\n    To part the Queen\\'s proud kindred from the Prince.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. My other self, my counsel\\'s consistory,\\r\\n    My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,\\r\\n    I, as a child, will go by thy direction.\\r\\n    Toward Ludlow then, for we\\'ll not stay behind.        Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. A street\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter one CITIZEN at one door, and another at the other\\r\\n\\r\\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so\\r\\n    fast?\\r\\n  SECOND CITIZEN. I promise you, I scarcely know myself.\\r\\n    Hear you the news abroad?\\r\\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Yes, that the King is dead.\\r\\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Ill news, by\\'r lady; seldom comes the\\r\\n    better.\\r\\n    I fear, I fear \\'twill prove a giddy world.\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter another CITIZEN\\r\\n\\r\\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Neighbours, God speed!\\r\\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Give you good morrow, sir.\\r\\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of good King Edward\\'s\\r\\n    death?\\r\\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while! \\r\\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Then, masters, look to see a troublous\\r\\n    world.\\r\\n  FIRST CITIZEN. No, no; by God\\'s good grace, his son shall\\r\\n    reign.\\r\\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Woe to that land that\\'s govern\\'d by a child.\\r\\n  SECOND CITIZEN. In him there is a hope of government,\\r\\n    Which, in his nonage, council under him,\\r\\n    And, in his full and ripened years, himself,\\r\\n    No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.\\r\\n  FIRST CITIZEN. So stood the state when Henry the Sixth\\r\\n    Was crown\\'d in Paris but at nine months old.\\r\\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Stood the state so? No, no, good friends,\\r\\n    God wot;\\r\\n    For then this land was famously enrich\\'d\\r\\n    With politic grave counsel; then the King\\r\\n    Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.\\r\\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Why, so hath this, both by his father and\\r\\n    mother.\\r\\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Better it were they all came by his father,\\r\\n    Or by his father there were none at all; \\r\\n    For emulation who shall now be nearest\\r\\n    Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.\\r\\n    O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!\\r\\n    And the Queen\\'s sons and brothers haught and proud;\\r\\n    And were they to be rul\\'d, and not to rule,\\r\\n    This sickly land might solace as before.\\r\\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be\\r\\n    well.\\r\\n  THIRD CITIZEN. When clouds are seen, wise men put on\\r\\n    their cloaks;\\r\\n    When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;\\r\\n    When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?\\r\\n    Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.\\r\\n    All may be well; but, if God sort it so,\\r\\n    \\'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.\\r\\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.\\r\\n    You cannot reason almost with a man\\r\\n    That looks not heavily and fun of dread.\\r\\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, still is it so;\\r\\n    By a divine instinct men\\'s minds mistrust \\r\\n    Ensuing danger; as by proof we see\\r\\n    The water swell before a boist\\'rous storm.\\r\\n    But leave it all to God. Whither away?\\r\\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Marry, we were sent for to the justices.\\r\\n  THIRD CITIZEN. And so was I; I\\'ll bear you company.\\r\\n                                                          Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. The palace\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the young DUKE OF YORK, QUEEN\\r\\nELIZABETH,\\r\\nand the DUCHESS OF YORK\\r\\n\\r\\n  ARCHBISHOP. Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,\\r\\n    And at Northampton they do rest to-night;\\r\\n    To-morrow or next day they will be here.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. I long with all my heart to see the Prince.\\r\\n    I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But I hear no; they say my son of York\\r\\n    Has almost overta\\'en him in his growth.\\r\\n  YORK. Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.\\r\\n  YORK. Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,\\r\\n    My uncle Rivers talk\\'d how I did grow\\r\\n    More than my brother. \\'Ay,\\' quoth my uncle Gloucester\\r\\n    \\'Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace.\\'\\r\\n    And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,\\r\\n    Because sweet flow\\'rs are slow and weeds make haste. \\r\\n  DUCHESS. Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold\\r\\n    In him that did object the same to thee.\\r\\n    He was the wretched\\'st thing when he was young,\\r\\n    So long a-growing and so leisurely\\r\\n    That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious.\\r\\n  ARCHBISHOP. And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.\\r\\n  YORK. Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb\\'red,\\r\\n    I could have given my uncle\\'s Grace a flout\\r\\n    To touch his growth nearer than he touch\\'d mine.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.\\r\\n  YORK. Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast\\r\\n    That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.\\r\\n    \\'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.\\r\\n    Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?\\r\\n  YORK. Grandam, his nurse.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast\\r\\n    born.\\r\\n  YORK. If \\'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me. \\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. A parlous boy! Go to, you are too\\r\\n    shrewd.\\r\\n  ARCHBISHOP. Good madam, be not angry with the child.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Pitchers have ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter a MESSENGER\\r\\n\\r\\n  ARCHBISHOP. Here comes a messenger. What news?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. How doth the Prince?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Well, madam, and in health.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. What is thy news?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Lord Rivers and Lord Grey\\r\\n    Are sent to Pomfret, and with them\\r\\n    Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. Who hath committed them?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.\\r\\n  ARCHBISHOP. For what offence?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. The sum of all I can, I have disclos\\'d.\\r\\n    Why or for what the nobles were committed \\r\\n    Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay me, I see the ruin of my house!\\r\\n    The tiger now hath seiz\\'d the gentle hind;\\r\\n    Insulting tyranny begins to jet\\r\\n    Upon the innocent and aweless throne.\\r\\n    Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!\\r\\n    I see, as in a map, the end of all.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,\\r\\n    How many of you have mine eyes beheld!\\r\\n    My husband lost his life to get the crown;\\r\\n    And often up and down my sons were toss\\'d\\r\\n    For me to joy and weep their gain and loss;\\r\\n    And being seated, and domestic broils\\r\\n    Clean over-blown, themselves the conquerors\\r\\n    Make war upon themselves-brother to brother,\\r\\n    Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous\\r\\n    And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,\\r\\n    Or let me die, to look on death no more!\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, my boy; we will to\\r\\n    sanctuary. \\r\\n    Madam, farewell.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. Stay, I will go with you.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. You have no cause.\\r\\n  ARCHBISHOP.  [To the QUEEN]  My gracious lady, go.\\r\\n    And thither bear your treasure and your goods.\\r\\n    For my part, I\\'ll resign unto your Grace\\r\\n    The seal I keep; and so betide to me\\r\\n    As well I tender you and all of yours!\\r\\n    Go, I\\'ll conduct you to the sanctuary.

A street\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trumpets sound. Enter the PRINCE OF WALES, GLOUCESTER,\\r\\nBUCKINGHAM,\\r\\nCATESBY, CARDINAL BOURCHIER, and others\\r\\n\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your\\r\\n    chamber.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts\\' sovereign.\\r\\n    The weary way hath made you melancholy.\\r\\n  PRINCE. No, uncle; but our crosses on the way\\r\\n    Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.\\r\\n    I want more uncles here to welcome me.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your\\r\\n    years\\r\\n    Hath not yet div\\'d into the world\\'s deceit;\\r\\n    Nor more can you distinguish of a man\\r\\n    Than of his outward show; which, God He knows,\\r\\n    Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.\\r\\n    Those uncles which you want were dangerous;\\r\\n    Your Grace attended to their sug\\'red words \\r\\n    But look\\'d not on the poison of their hearts.\\r\\n    God keep you from them and from such false friends!\\r\\n  PRINCE. God keep me from false friends! but they were\\r\\n    none.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet\\r\\n    you.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train\\r\\n\\r\\n  MAYOR. God bless your Grace with health and happy days!\\r\\n  PRINCE. I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.\\r\\n    I thought my mother and my brother York\\r\\n    Would long ere this have met us on the way.\\r\\n    Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not\\r\\n    To tell us whether they will come or no!\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter LORD HASTINGS\\r\\n\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time, here comes the sweating\\r\\n    Lord. \\r\\n  PRINCE. Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?\\r\\n  HASTINGS. On what occasion, God He knows, not I,\\r\\n    The Queen your mother and your brother York\\r\\n    Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince\\r\\n    Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,\\r\\n    But by his mother was perforce withheld.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Fie, what an indirect and peevish course\\r\\n    Is this of hers? Lord Cardinal, will your Grace\\r\\n    Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York\\r\\n    Unto his princely brother presently?\\r\\n    If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him\\r\\n    And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.\\r\\n  CARDINAL. My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory\\r\\n    Can from his mother win the Duke of York,\\r\\n    Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate\\r\\n    To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid\\r\\n    We should infringe the holy privilege\\r\\n    Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land\\r\\n    Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord, \\r\\n    Too ceremonious and traditional.\\r\\n    Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,\\r\\n    You break not sanctuary in seizing him.\\r\\n    The benefit thereof is always granted\\r\\n    To those whose dealings have deserv\\'d the place\\r\\n    And those who have the wit to claim the place.\\r\\n    This Prince hath neither claim\\'d it nor deserv\\'d it,\\r\\n    And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.\\r\\n    Then, taking him from thence that is not there,\\r\\n    You break no privilege nor charter there.\\r\\n    Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;\\r\\n    But sanctuary children never till now.\\r\\n  CARDINAL. My lord, you shall o\\'errule my mind for once.\\r\\n    Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?\\r\\n  HASTINGS. I go, my lord.\\r\\n  PRINCE. Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.\\r\\n                                    Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS\\r\\n    Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,\\r\\n    Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Where it seems best unto your royal self. \\r\\n    If I may counsel you, some day or two\\r\\n    Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower,\\r\\n    Then where you please and shall be thought most fit\\r\\n    For your best health and recreation.\\r\\n  PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place.\\r\\n    Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,\\r\\n    Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.\\r\\n  PRINCE. Is it upon record, or else reported\\r\\n    Successively from age to age, he built it?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Upon record, my gracious lord.\\r\\n  PRINCE. But say, my lord, it were not regist\\'red,\\r\\n    Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age,\\r\\n    As \\'twere retail\\'d to all posterity,\\r\\n    Even to the general all-ending day.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never\\r\\n    live long.\\r\\n  PRINCE. What say you, uncle?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I say, without characters, fame lives long.\\r\\n    [Aside]  Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity, \\r\\n    I moralize two meanings in one word.\\r\\n  PRINCE. That Julius Caesar was a famous man;\\r\\n    With what his valour did enrich his wit,\\r\\n    His wit set down to make his valour live.\\r\\n    Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;\\r\\n    For now he lives in fame, though not in life.\\r\\n    I\\'ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham-\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?\\r\\n  PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man,\\r\\n    I\\'ll win our ancient right in France again,\\r\\n    Or die a soldier as I liv\\'d a king.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward\\r\\n    spring.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Enter HASTINGS, young YORK, and the CARDINAL\\r\\n\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of\\r\\n    York.\\r\\n  PRINCE. Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?\\r\\n  YORK. Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now. \\r\\n  PRINCE. Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours.\\r\\n    Too late he died that might have kept that title,\\r\\n    Which by his death hath lost much majesty.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?\\r\\n  YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,\\r\\n    You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.\\r\\n    The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. He hath, my lord.\\r\\n  YORK. And therefore is he idle?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.\\r\\n  YORK. Then he is more beholding to you than I.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. He may command me as my sovereign;\\r\\n    But you have power in me as in a kinsman.\\r\\n  YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart!\\r\\n  PRINCE. A beggar, brother?\\r\\n  YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,\\r\\n    And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. A greater gift than that I\\'ll give my cousin.\\r\\n  YORK. A greater gift! O, that\\'s the sword to it! \\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.\\r\\n  YORK. O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts:\\r\\n    In weightier things you\\'ll say a beggar nay.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.\\r\\n  YORK. I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. What, would you have my weapon, little\\r\\n    Lord?\\r\\n  YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you call me.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. How?\\r\\n  YORK. Little.\\r\\n  PRINCE. My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.\\r\\n    Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.\\r\\n  YORK. You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.\\r\\n    Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;\\r\\n    Because that I am little, like an ape,\\r\\n    He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!\\r\\n    To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle\\r\\n    He prettily and aptly taunts himself.\\r\\n    So cunning and so young is wonderful. \\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. My lord, will\\'t please you pass along?\\r\\n    Myself and my good cousin Buckingham\\r\\n    Will to your mother, to entreat of her\\r\\n    To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.\\r\\n  YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?\\r\\n  PRINCE. My Lord Protector needs will have it so.\\r\\n  YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Why, what should you fear?\\r\\n  YORK. Marry, my uncle Clarence\\' angry ghost.\\r\\n    My grandam told me he was murder\\'d there.\\r\\n  PRINCE. I fear no uncles dead.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Nor none that live, I hope.\\r\\n  PRINCE. An if they live, I hope I need not fear.\\r\\n    But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,\\r\\n    Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.\\r\\n    A sennet.\\r\\n              Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, and CATESBY\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Think you, my lord, this little prating York\\r\\n    Was not incensed by his subtle mother\\r\\n    To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously? \\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt. O, \\'tis a perilous boy;\\r\\n    Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.\\r\\n    He is all the mother\\'s, from the top to toe.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.\\r\\n    Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend\\r\\n    As closely to conceal what we impart.\\r\\n    Thou know\\'st our reasons urg\\'d upon the way.\\r\\n    What think\\'st thou? Is it not an easy matter\\r\\n    To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,\\r\\n    For the instalment of this noble Duke\\r\\n    In the seat royal of this famous isle?\\r\\n  CATESBY. He for his father\\'s sake so loves the Prince\\r\\n    That he will not be won to aught against him.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. What think\\'st thou then of Stanley? Will\\r\\n    not he?\\r\\n  CATESBY. He will do all in all as Hastings doth.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Well then, no more but this: go, gentle\\r\\n    Catesby,\\r\\n    And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings\\r\\n    How he doth stand affected to our purpose; \\r\\n    And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,\\r\\n    To sit about the coronation.\\r\\n    If thou dost find him tractable to us,\\r\\n    Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons;\\r\\n    If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,\\r\\n    Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,\\r\\n    And give us notice of his inclination;\\r\\n    For we to-morrow hold divided councils,\\r\\n    Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ\\'d.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Commend me to Lord William. Tell him,\\r\\n    Catesby,\\r\\n    His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries\\r\\n    To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle;\\r\\n    And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,\\r\\n    Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.\\r\\n  CATESBY. My good lords both, with all the heed I can.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?\\r\\n  CATESBY. You shall, my lord.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. At Crosby House, there shall you find us both. \\r\\n                                                    Exit CATESBY\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shall we do if we\\r\\n    perceive\\r\\n    Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Chop off his head-something we will\\r\\n    determine.\\r\\n    And, look when I am King, claim thou of me\\r\\n    The earldom of Hereford and all the movables\\r\\n    Whereof the King my brother was possess\\'d.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. I\\'ll claim that promise at your Grace\\'s hand.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. And look to have it yielded with all kindness.\\r\\n    Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards\\r\\n    We may digest our complots in some form.              Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore LORD HASTING\\'S house\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a MESSENGER to the door of HASTINGS\\r\\n\\r\\n  MESSENGER. My lord, my lord!                        [Knocking]\\r\\n  HASTINGS.  [Within]  Who knocks?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley.\\r\\n  HASTINGS.  [Within]  What is\\'t o\\'clock?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four.\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter LORD HASTINGS\\r\\n\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious\\r\\n    nights?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. So it appears by that I have to say.\\r\\n    First, he commends him to your noble self.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. What then?\\r\\n  MESSENGER. Then certifies your lordship that this night\\r\\n    He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.\\r\\n    Besides, he says there are two councils kept,\\r\\n    And that may be determin\\'d at the one \\r\\n    Which may make you and him to rue at th\\' other.\\r\\n    Therefore he sends to know your lordship\\'s pleasure-\\r\\n    If you will presently take horse with him\\r\\n    And with all speed post with him toward the north\\r\\n    To shun the danger that his soul divines.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;\\r\\n    Bid him not fear the separated council:\\r\\n    His honour and myself are at the one,\\r\\n    And at the other is my good friend Catesby;\\r\\n    Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us\\r\\n    Whereof I shall not have intelligence.\\r\\n    Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance;\\r\\n    And for his dreams, I wonder he\\'s so simple\\r\\n    To trust the mock\\'ry of unquiet slumbers.\\r\\n    To fly the boar before the boar pursues\\r\\n    Were to incense the boar to follow us\\r\\n    And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.\\r\\n    Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;\\r\\n    And we will both together to the Tower,\\r\\n    Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly. \\r\\n  MESSENGER. I\\'ll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.\\r\\n Exit\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Enter CATESBY\\r\\n\\r\\n  CATESBY. Many good morrows to my noble lord!\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring.\\r\\n    What news, what news, in this our tott\\'ring state?\\r\\n  CATESBY. It is a reeling world indeed, my lord;\\r\\n    And I believe will never stand upright\\r\\n    Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the\\r\\n    crown?\\r\\n  CATESBY. Ay, my good lord.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. I\\'ll have this crown of mine cut from my\\r\\n    shoulders\\r\\n    Before I\\'ll see the crown so foul misplac\\'d.\\r\\n    But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?\\r\\n  CATESBY. Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward\\r\\n    Upon his party for the gain thereof; \\r\\n    And thereupon he sends you this good news,\\r\\n    That this same very day your enemies,\\r\\n    The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,\\r\\n    Because they have been still my adversaries;\\r\\n    But that I\\'ll give my voice on Richard\\'s side\\r\\n    To bar my master\\'s heirs in true descent,\\r\\n    God knows I will not do it to the death.\\r\\n  CATESBY. God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!\\r\\n  HASTINGS. But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,\\r\\n    That they which brought me in my master\\'s hate,\\r\\n    I live to look upon their tragedy.\\r\\n    Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,\\r\\n    I\\'ll send some packing that yet think not on\\'t.\\r\\n  CATESBY. \\'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,\\r\\n    When men are unprepar\\'d and look not for it.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out\\r\\n    With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so \\'twill do\\r\\n    With some men else that think themselves as safe\\r\\n    As thou and I, who, as thou knowest, are dear \\r\\n    To princely Richard and to Buckingham.\\r\\n  CATESBY. The Princes both make high account of you-\\r\\n    [Aside]  For they account his head upon the bridge.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. I know they do, and I have well deserv\\'d it.\\r\\n\\r\\n                      Enter LORD STANLEY\\r\\n\\r\\n    Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?\\r\\n    Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?\\r\\n  STANLEY. My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby.\\r\\n    You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,\\r\\n    I do not like these several councils, I.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours,\\r\\n    And never in my days, I do protest,\\r\\n    Was it so precious to me as \\'tis now.\\r\\n    Think you, but that I know our state secure,\\r\\n    I would be so triumphant as I am?\\r\\n  STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from\\r\\n    London,\\r\\n    Were jocund and suppos\\'d their states were sure, \\r\\n    And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;\\r\\n    But yet you see how soon the day o\\'ercast.\\r\\n    This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt;\\r\\n    Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward.\\r\\n    What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my\\r\\n    Lord?\\r\\n    To-day the lords you talk\\'d of are beheaded.\\r\\n  STANLEY. They, for their truth, might better wear their\\r\\n    heads\\r\\n    Than some that have accus\\'d them wear their hats.\\r\\n    But come, my lord, let\\'s away.\\r\\n\\r\\n                 Enter HASTINGS, a pursuivant\\r\\n\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Go on before; I\\'ll talk with this good fellow.\\r\\n                                      Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY\\r\\n    How now, Hastings! How goes the world with thee?\\r\\n  PURSUIVANT. The better that your lordship please to ask.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. I tell thee, man, \\'tis better with me now \\r\\n    Than when thou met\\'st me last where now we meet:\\r\\n    Then was I going prisoner to the Tower\\r\\n    By the suggestion of the Queen\\'s allies;\\r\\n    But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself-\\r\\n    This day those enernies are put to death,\\r\\n    And I in better state than e\\'er I was.\\r\\n  PURSUIVANT. God hold it, to your honour\\'s good content!\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Gramercy, Hastings; there, drink that for me.\\r\\n                                          [Throws him his purse]\\r\\n  PURSUIVANT. I thank your honour.                          Exit\\r\\n\\r\\n                            Enter a PRIEST\\r\\n\\r\\n  PRIEST. Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.\\r\\n    I am in your debt for your last exercise;\\r\\n    Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.\\r\\n                                        [He whispers in his ear]\\r\\n  PRIEST. I\\'ll wait upon your lordship.\\r\\n \\r\\n                            Enter BUCKINGHAM\\r\\n\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. What, talking with a priest, Lord\\r\\n    Chamberlain!\\r\\n    Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest:\\r\\n    Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Good faith, and when I met this holy man,\\r\\n    The men you talk of came into my mind.\\r\\n    What, go you toward the Tower?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there;\\r\\n    I shall return before your lordship thence.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM.  [Aside]  And supper too, although thou\\r\\n    knowest it not.-\\r\\n    Come, will you go?\\r\\n  HASTINGS. I\\'ll wait upon your lordship.                 Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nPomfret Castle\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying the Nobles,\\r\\nRIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN, to death\\r\\n\\r\\n  RIVERS. Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:\\r\\n    To-day shalt thou behold a subject die\\r\\n    For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.\\r\\n  GREY. God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!\\r\\n    A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.\\r\\n  VAUGHAN. You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.\\r\\n  RATCLIFF. Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.\\r\\n  RIVERS. O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,\\r\\n    Fatal and ominous to noble peers!\\r\\n    Within the guilty closure of thy walls\\r\\n  RICHARD the Second here was hack\\'d to death;\\r\\n    And for more slander to thy dismal seat,\\r\\n    We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.\\r\\n  GREY. Now Margaret\\'s curse is fall\\'n upon our heads,\\r\\n    When she exclaim\\'d on Hastings, you, and I, \\r\\n    For standing by when Richard stabb\\'d her son.\\r\\n  RIVERS. Then curs\\'d she Richard, then curs\\'d she\\r\\n    Buckingham,\\r\\n    Then curs\\'d she Hastings. O, remember, God,\\r\\n    To hear her prayer for them, as now for us!\\r\\n    And for my sister, and her princely sons,\\r\\n    Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,\\r\\n    Which, as thou know\\'st, unjustly must be spilt.\\r\\n  RATCLIFF. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.\\r\\n  RIVERS. Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace.\\r\\n    Farewell, until we meet again in heaven.              Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 4\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. The Tower\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP of ELY, RATCLIFF,\\r\\nLOVEL,\\r\\nwith others and seat themselves at a table\\r\\n\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met\\r\\n    Is to determine of the coronation.\\r\\n    In God\\'s name speak-when is the royal day?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Is all things ready for the royal time?\\r\\n  DERBY. It is, and wants but nomination.\\r\\n  BISHOP OF ELY. To-morrow then I judge a happy day.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector\\'s mind\\r\\n    herein?\\r\\n    Who is most inward with the noble Duke?\\r\\n  BISHOP OF ELY. Your Grace, we think, should soonest know\\r\\n    his mind.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. We know each other\\'s faces; for our hearts,\\r\\n    He knows no more of mine than I of yours;\\r\\n    Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.\\r\\n    Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love. \\r\\n  HASTINGS. I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;\\r\\n    But for his purpose in the coronation\\r\\n    I have not sounded him, nor he deliver\\'d\\r\\n    His gracious pleasure any way therein.\\r\\n    But you, my honourable lords, may name the time;\\r\\n    And in the Duke\\'s behalf I\\'ll give my voice,\\r\\n    Which, I presume, he\\'ll take in gentle part.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter GLOUCESTER\\r\\n\\r\\n  BISHOP OF ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. My noble lords and cousins an, good morrow.\\r\\n    I have been long a sleeper, but I trust\\r\\n    My absence doth neglect no great design\\r\\n    Which by my presence might have been concluded.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,\\r\\n  WILLIAM Lord Hastings had pronounc\\'d your part-\\r\\n    I mean, your voice for crowning of the King.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Than my Lord Hastings no man might be\\r\\n    bolder; \\r\\n    His lordship knows me well and loves me well.\\r\\n    My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn\\r\\n    I saw good strawberries in your garden there.\\r\\n    I do beseech you send for some of them.\\r\\n  BISHOP of ELY. Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.\\r\\n Exit\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.\\r\\n                                               [Takes him aside]\\r\\n    Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,\\r\\n    And finds the testy gentleman so hot\\r\\n    That he will lose his head ere give consent\\r\\n    His master\\'s child, as worshipfully he terms it,\\r\\n    Shall lose the royalty of England\\'s throne.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Withdraw yourself awhile; I\\'ll go with you.\\r\\n                                Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM\\r\\n  DERBY. We have not yet set down this day of triumph.\\r\\n    To-morrow, in my judgment, is too sudden;\\r\\n    For I myself am not so well provided\\r\\n    As else I would be, were the day prolong\\'d.\\r\\n \\r\\n                    Re-enter the BISHOP OF ELY\\r\\n\\r\\n  BISHOP OF ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?\\r\\n    I have sent for these strawberries.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this\\r\\n    morning;\\r\\n    There\\'s some conceit or other likes him well\\r\\n    When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.\\r\\n    I think there\\'s never a man in Christendom\\r\\n    Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;\\r\\n    For by his face straight shall you know his heart.\\r\\n  DERBY. What of his heart perceive you in his face\\r\\n    By any livelihood he show\\'d to-day?\\r\\n  HASTINGS. Marry, that with no man here he is offended;\\r\\n    For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM\\r\\n\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I pray you all, tell me what they deserve\\r\\n    That do conspire my death with devilish plots \\r\\n    Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail\\'d\\r\\n    Upon my body with their hellish charms?\\r\\n  HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,\\r\\n    Makes me most forward in this princely presence\\r\\n    To doom th\\' offenders, whosoe\\'er they be.\\r\\n    I say, my lord, they have deserved death.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.\\r\\n    Look how I am bewitch\\'d; behold, mine arm\\r\\n    Is like a blasted sapling wither\\'d up.\\r\\n    And this is Edward\\'s wife, that monstrous witch,\\r\\n    Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,\\r\\n    That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. If they have done this deed, my noble lord-\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet,\\r\\n    Talk\\'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor.\\r\\n    Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear\\r\\n    I will not dine until I see the same.\\r\\n    Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done.\\r\\n    The rest that love me, rise and follow me.\\r\\n                    Exeunt all but HASTINGS, LOVEL, and RATCLIFF \\r\\n  HASTINGS. Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me;\\r\\n    For I, too fond, might have prevented this.\\r\\n  STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms,\\r\\n    And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.\\r\\n    Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,\\r\\n    And started when he look\\'d upon the Tower,\\r\\n    As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.\\r\\n    O, now I need the priest that spake to me!\\r\\n    I now repent I told the pursuivant,\\r\\n    As too triumphing, how mine enemies\\r\\n    To-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher\\'d,\\r\\n    And I myself secure in grace and favour.\\r\\n    O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse\\r\\n    Is lighted on poor Hastings\\' wretched head!\\r\\n  RATCLIFF. Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at\\r\\n    dinner.\\r\\n    Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. O momentary grace of mortal men,\\r\\n    Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!\\r\\n    Who builds his hope in air of your good looks \\r\\n    Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,\\r\\n    Ready with every nod to tumble down\\r\\n    Into the fatal bowels of the deep.\\r\\n  LOVEL. Come, come, dispatch; \\'tis bootless to exclaim.\\r\\n  HASTINGS. O bloody Richard! Miserable England!\\r\\n    I prophesy the fearfull\\'st time to thee\\r\\n    That ever wretched age hath look\\'d upon.\\r\\n    Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.\\r\\n    They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.           Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. The Tower-walls\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rotten armour, marvellous\\r\\nill-favoured\\r\\n\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change\\r\\n    thy colour,\\r\\n    Murder thy breath in middle of a word,\\r\\n    And then again begin, and stop again,\\r\\n    As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;\\r\\n    Speak and look back, and pry on every side,\\r\\n    Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,\\r\\n    Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks\\r\\n    Are at my service, like enforced smiles;\\r\\n    And both are ready in their offices\\r\\n    At any time to grace my stratagems.\\r\\n    But what, is Catesby gone?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.\\r\\n\\r\\n                 Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY \\r\\n\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor-\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Look to the drawbridge there!\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Hark! a drum.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Catesby, o\\'erlook the walls.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent-\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Look back, defend thee; here are enemies.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!\\r\\n\\r\\n           Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS\\' head\\r\\n\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Be patient; they are friends-Ratcliff and Lovel.\\r\\n  LOVEL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,\\r\\n    The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. So dear I lov\\'d the man that I must weep.\\r\\n    I took him for the plainest harmless creature\\r\\n    That breath\\'d upon the earth a Christian;\\r\\n    Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded\\r\\n    The history of all her secret thoughts.\\r\\n    So smooth he daub\\'d his vice with show of virtue \\r\\n    That, his apparent open guilt omitted,\\r\\n    I mean his conversation with Shore\\'s wife-\\r\\n    He liv\\'d from all attainder of suspects.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Well, well, he was the covert\\'st shelt\\'red\\r\\n    traitor\\r\\n    That ever liv\\'d.\\r\\n    Would you imagine, or almost believe-\\r\\n    Were\\'t not that by great preservation\\r\\n    We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor\\r\\n    This day had plotted, in the council-house,\\r\\n    To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester.\\r\\n  MAYOR. Had he done so?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?\\r\\n    Or that we would, against the form of law,\\r\\n    Proceed thus rashly in the villain\\'s death\\r\\n    But that the extreme peril of the case,\\r\\n    The peace of England and our persons\\' safety,\\r\\n    Enforc\\'d us to this execution?\\r\\n  MAYOR. Now, fair befall you! He deserv\\'d his death;\\r\\n    And your good Graces both have well proceeded \\r\\n    To warn false traitors from the like attempts.\\r\\n    I never look\\'d for better at his hands\\r\\n    After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin\\'d he should die\\r\\n    Until your lordship came to see his end-\\r\\n    Which now the loving haste of these our friends,\\r\\n    Something against our meanings, have prevented-\\r\\n    Because, my lord, I would have had you heard\\r\\n    The traitor speak, and timorously confess\\r\\n    The manner and the purpose of his treasons:\\r\\n    That you might well have signified the same\\r\\n    Unto the citizens, who haply may\\r\\n    Misconster us in him and wail his death.\\r\\n  MAYOR. But, my good lord, your Grace\\'s words shall serve\\r\\n    As well as I had seen and heard him speak;\\r\\n    And do not doubt, right noble Princes both,\\r\\n    But I\\'ll acquaint our duteous citizens\\r\\n    With all your just proceedings in this cause.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. And to that end we wish\\'d your lordship here,\\r\\n    T\\' avoid the the the censures of the carping world. \\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Which since you come too late of our intent,\\r\\n    Yet witness what you hear we did intend.\\r\\n    And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.\\r\\n                                                 Exit LORD MAYOR\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.\\r\\n    The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post.\\r\\n    There, at your meet\\'st advantage of the time,\\r\\n    Infer the bastardy of Edward\\'s children.\\r\\n    Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen\\r\\n    Only for saying he would make his son\\r\\n    Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,\\r\\n    Which by the sign thereof was termed so.\\r\\n    Moreover, urge his hateful luxury\\r\\n    And bestial appetite in change of lust,\\r\\n    Which stretch\\'d unto their servants, daughters, wives,\\r\\n    Even where his raging eye or savage heart\\r\\n    Without control lusted to make a prey.\\r\\n    Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:\\r\\n    Tell them, when that my mother went with child\\r\\n    Of that insatiate Edward, noble York \\r\\n    My princely father then had wars in France\\r\\n    And, by true computation of the time,\\r\\n    Found that the issue was not his begot;\\r\\n    Which well appeared in his lineaments,\\r\\n    Being nothing like the noble Duke my father.\\r\\n    Yet touch this sparingly, as \\'twere far off;\\r\\n    Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I\\'ll play the orator\\r\\n    As if the golden fee for which I plead\\r\\n    Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard\\'s\\r\\n    Castle;\\r\\n    Where you shall find me well accompanied\\r\\n    With reverend fathers and well learned bishops.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. I go; and towards three or four o\\'clock\\r\\n    Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.           Exit\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.\\r\\n    [To CATESBY]  Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them both\\r\\n    Meet me within this hour at Baynard\\'s Castle.\\r\\n                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER \\r\\n    Now will I go to take some privy order\\r\\n    To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,\\r\\n    And to give order that no manner person\\r\\n    Have any time recourse unto the Princes.

Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;\\r\\n    Which in a set hand fairly is engross\\'d\\r\\n    That it may be to-day read o\\'er in Paul\\'s.\\r\\n    And mark how well the sequel hangs together:\\r\\n    Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,\\r\\n    For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;\\r\\n    The precedent was full as long a-doing;\\r\\n    And yet within these five hours Hastings liv\\'d,\\r\\n    Untainted, unexamin\\'d, free, at liberty.\\r\\n    Here\\'s a good world the while! Who is so gros\\r\\n    That cannot see this palpable device?\\r\\n    Yet who\\'s so bold but says he sees it not?\\r\\n    Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,\\r\\n    When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.

I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,\\r\\n    And his contract by deputy in France;\\r\\n    Th\\' insatiate greediness of his desire,\\r\\n    And his enforcement of the city wives;\\r\\n    His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,\\r\\n    As being got, your father then in France,\\r\\n    And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.\\r\\n    Withal I did infer your lineaments,\\r\\n    Being the right idea of your father,\\r\\n    Both in your form and nobleness of mind;\\r\\n    Laid open all your victories in Scotland,\\r\\n    Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace, \\r\\n    Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;\\r\\n    Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose\\r\\n    Untouch\\'d or slightly handled in discourse.\\r\\n    And when mine oratory drew toward end\\r\\n    I bid them that did love their country\\'s good\\r\\n    Cry \\'God save Richard, England\\'s royal King!\\'\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. And did they so?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. No, so God help me, they spake not a word;\\r\\n    But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,\\r\\n    Star\\'d each on other, and look\\'d deadly pale.\\r\\n    Which when I saw, I reprehended them,\\r\\n    And ask\\'d the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence.\\r\\n    His answer was, the people were not used\\r\\n    To be spoke to but by the Recorder.\\r\\n    Then he was urg\\'d to tell my tale again.\\r\\n    \\'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr\\'d\\'-\\r\\n    But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.\\r\\n    When he had done, some followers of mine own\\r\\n    At lower end of the hall hurl\\'d up their caps,\\r\\n    And some ten voices cried \\'God save King Richard!\\' \\r\\n    And thus I took the vantage of those few-\\r\\n    \\'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,\\' quoth I\\r\\n    \\'This general applause and cheerful shout\\r\\n    Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.\\'\\r\\n    And even here brake off and came away.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. What, tongueless blocks were they? Would\\r\\n    they not speak?\\r\\n    Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;\\r\\n    Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit;\\r\\n    And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,\\r\\n    And stand between two churchmen, good my lord;\\r\\n    For on that ground I\\'ll make a holy descant;\\r\\n    And be not easily won to our requests.\\r\\n    Play the maid\\'s part: still answer nay, and take it.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I go; and if you plead as well for them\\r\\n    As I can say nay to thee for myself,\\r\\n    No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor\\r\\n    knocks.                                      Exit GLOUCESTER \\r\\n\\r\\n           Enter the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and citizens\\r\\n\\r\\n    Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here;\\r\\n    I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Enter CATESBY\\r\\n\\r\\n    Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?\\r\\n  CATESBY. He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,\\r\\n    To visit him to-morrow or next day.\\r\\n    He is within, with two right reverend fathers,\\r\\n    Divinely bent to meditation;\\r\\n    And in no worldly suits would he be mov\\'d,\\r\\n    To draw him from his holy exercise.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke;\\r\\n    Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen,\\r\\n    In deep designs, in matter of great moment,\\r\\n    No less importing than our general good,\\r\\n    Are come to have some conference with his Grace. \\r\\n  CATESBY. I\\'ll signify so much unto him straight.          Exit\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!\\r\\n    He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,\\r\\n    But on his knees at meditation;\\r\\n    Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,\\r\\n    But meditating with two deep divines;\\r\\n    Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,\\r\\n    But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.\\r\\n    Happy were England would this virtuous prince\\r\\n    Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof;\\r\\n    But, sure, I fear we shall not win him to it.\\r\\n  MAYOR. Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Re-enter CATESBY\\r\\n\\r\\n    Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?\\r\\n  CATESBY. My lord,\\r\\n    He wonders to what end you have assembled\\r\\n    Such troops of citizens to come to him. \\r\\n    His Grace not being warn\\'d thereof before,\\r\\n    He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Sorry I am my noble cousin should\\r\\n    Suspect me that I mean no good to him.\\r\\n    By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;\\r\\n    And so once more return and tell his Grace.\\r\\n                                                    Exit CATESBY\\r\\n    When holy and devout religious men\\r\\n    Are at their beads, \\'tis much to draw them thence,\\r\\n    So sweet is zealous contemplation.\\r\\n\\r\\n           Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two BISHOPS.\\r\\n                      CATESBY returns\\r\\n\\r\\n  MAYOR. See where his Grace stands \\'tween two clergymen!\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,\\r\\n    To stay him from the fall of vanity;\\r\\n    And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,\\r\\n    True ornaments to know a holy man.\\r\\n    Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince, \\r\\n    Lend favourable ear to our requests,\\r\\n    And pardon us the interruption\\r\\n    Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. My lord, there needs no such apology:\\r\\n    I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,\\r\\n    Who, earnest in the service of my God,\\r\\n    Deferr\\'d the visitation of my friends.\\r\\n    But, leaving this, what is your Grace\\'s pleasure?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,\\r\\n    And all good men of this ungovern\\'d isle.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I do suspect I have done some offence\\r\\n    That seems disgracious in the city\\'s eye,\\r\\n    And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. You have, my lord. Would it might please\\r\\n    your Grace,\\r\\n    On our entreaties, to amend your fault!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Know then, it is your fault that you resign\\r\\n    The supreme seat, the throne majestical,\\r\\n    The scept\\'red office of your ancestors, \\r\\n    Your state of fortune and your due of birth,\\r\\n    The lineal glory of your royal house,\\r\\n    To the corruption of a blemish\\'d stock;\\r\\n    Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,\\r\\n    Which here we waken to our country\\'s good,\\r\\n    The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;\\r\\n    Her face defac\\'d with scars of infamy,\\r\\n    Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,\\r\\n    And almost should\\'red in the swallowing gulf\\r\\n    Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.\\r\\n    Which to recure, we heartily solicit\\r\\n    Your gracious self to take on you the charge\\r\\n    And kingly government of this your land-\\r\\n    Not as protector, steward, substitute,\\r\\n    Or lowly factor for another\\'s gain;\\r\\n    But as successively, from blood to blood,\\r\\n    Your right of birth, your empery, your own.\\r\\n    For this, consorted with the citizens,\\r\\n    Your very worshipful and loving friends,\\r\\n    And by their vehement instigation, \\r\\n    In this just cause come I to move your Grace.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell if to depart in silence\\r\\n    Or bitterly to speak in your reproof\\r\\n    Best fitteth my degree or your condition.\\r\\n    If not to answer, you might haply think\\r\\n    Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded\\r\\n    To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,\\r\\n    Which fondly you would here impose on me;\\r\\n    If to reprove you for this suit of yours,\\r\\n    So season\\'d with your faithful love to me,\\r\\n    Then, on the other side, I check\\'d my friends.\\r\\n    Therefore-to speak, and to avoid the first,\\r\\n    And then, in speaking, not to incur the last-\\r\\n    Definitively thus I answer you:\\r\\n    Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert\\r\\n    Unmeritable shuns your high request.\\r\\n    First, if all obstacles were cut away,\\r\\n    And that my path were even to the crown,\\r\\n    As the ripe revenue and due of birth,\\r\\n    Yet so much is my poverty of spirit, \\r\\n    So mighty and so many my defects,\\r\\n    That I would rather hide me from my greatness-\\r\\n    Being a bark to brook no mighty sea-\\r\\n    Than in my greatness covet to be hid,\\r\\n    And in the vapour of my glory smother\\'d.\\r\\n    But, God be thank\\'d, there is no need of me-\\r\\n    And much I need to help you, were there need.\\r\\n    The royal tree hath left us royal fruit\\r\\n    Which, mellow\\'d by the stealing hours of time,\\r\\n    Will well become the seat of majesty\\r\\n    And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.\\r\\n    On him I lay that you would lay on me-\\r\\n    The right and fortune of his happy stars,\\r\\n    Which God defend that I should wring from him.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, this argues conscience in your\\r\\n    Grace;\\r\\n    But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,\\r\\n    All circumstances well considered.\\r\\n    You say that Edward is your brother\\'s son.\\r\\n    So say we too, but not by Edward\\'s wife; \\r\\n    For first was he contract to Lady Lucy-\\r\\n    Your mother lives a witness to his vow-\\r\\n    And afterward by substitute betroth\\'d\\r\\n    To Bona, sister to the King of France.\\r\\n    These both put off, a poor petitioner,\\r\\n    A care-craz\\'d mother to a many sons,\\r\\n    A beauty-waning and distressed widow,\\r\\n    Even in the afternoon of her best days,\\r\\n    Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,\\r\\n    Seduc\\'d the pitch and height of his degree\\r\\n    To base declension and loath\\'d bigamy.\\r\\n    By her, in his unlawful bed, he got\\r\\n    This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.\\r\\n    More bitterly could I expostulate,\\r\\n    Save that, for reverence to some alive,\\r\\n    I give a sparing limit to my tongue.\\r\\n    Then, good my lord, take to your royal self\\r\\n    This proffer\\'d benefit of dignity;\\r\\n    If not to bless us and the land withal,\\r\\n    Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry \\r\\n    From the corruption of abusing times\\r\\n    Unto a lineal true-derived course.\\r\\n  MAYOR. Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer\\'d love.\\r\\n  CATESBY. O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Alas, why would you heap this care on me?\\r\\n    I am unfit for state and majesty.\\r\\n    I do beseech you, take it not amiss:\\r\\n    I cannot nor I will not yield to you.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal,\\r\\n    Loath to depose the child, your brother\\'s son;\\r\\n    As well we know your tenderness of heart\\r\\n    And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,\\r\\n    Which we have noted in you to your kindred\\r\\n    And egally indeed to all estates-\\r\\n    Yet know, whe\\'er you accept our suit or no,\\r\\n    Your brother\\'s son shall never reign our king;\\r\\n    But we will plant some other in the throne\\r\\n    To the disgrace and downfall of your house;\\r\\n    And in this resolution here we leave you. \\r\\n    Come, citizens. Zounds, I\\'ll entreat no more.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.\\r\\n                          Exeunt BUCKINGHAM, MAYOR, and citizens\\r\\n  CATESBY. Call him again, sweet Prince, accept their suit.\\r\\n    If you deny them, all the land will rue it.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Will you enforce me to a world of cares?\\r\\n    Call them again. I am not made of stones,\\r\\n    But penetrable to your kind entreaties,\\r\\n    Albeit against my conscience and my soul.\\r\\n\\r\\n                  Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest\\r\\n\\r\\n    Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men,\\r\\n    Since you will buckle fortune on my back,\\r\\n    To bear her burden, whe\\'er I will or no,\\r\\n    I must have patience to endure the load;\\r\\n    But if black scandal or foul-fac\\'d reproach\\r\\n    Attend the sequel of your imposition,\\r\\n    Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me\\r\\n    From all the impure blots and stains thereof; \\r\\n    For God doth know, and you may partly see,\\r\\n    How far I am from the desire of this.\\r\\n  MAYOR. God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shall but say the truth.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Then I salute you with this royal title-\\r\\n    Long live King Richard, England\\'s worthy King!\\r\\n  ALL. Amen.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow may it please you to be crown\\'d?\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER. Even when you please, for you will have it so.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow, then, we will attend your Grace;\\r\\n    And so, most joyfully, we take our leave.\\r\\n  GLOUCESTER.  [To the BISHOPS]  Come, let us to our holy\\r\\n    work again.\\r\\n    Farewell, my cousin; farewell, gentle friends.

Before the Tower\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS of YORK, and MARQUIS of DORSET, at\\r\\none door;\\r\\nANNE, DUCHESS of GLOUCESTER, leading LADY MARGARET PLANTAGENET,\\r\\nCLARENCE\\'s young daughter, at another door\\r\\n\\r\\n  DUCHESS. Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet,\\r\\n    Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?\\r\\n    Now, for my life, she\\'s wand\\'ring to the Tower,\\r\\n    On pure heart\\'s love, to greet the tender Princes.\\r\\n    Daughter, well met.\\r\\n  ANNE. God give your Graces both\\r\\n    A happy and a joyful time of day!\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As much to you, good sister! Whither\\r\\n    away?\\r\\n  ANNE. No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,\\r\\n    Upon the like devotion as yourselves,\\r\\n    To gratulate the gentle Princes there.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Kind sister, thanks; we\\'ll enter \\r\\n    all together.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter BRAKENBURY\\r\\n\\r\\n    And in good time, here the lieutenant comes.\\r\\n    Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,\\r\\n    How doth the Prince, and my young son of York?\\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. Right well, dear madam. By your patience,\\r\\n    I may not suffer you to visit them.\\r\\n    The King hath strictly charg\\'d the contrary.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The King! Who\\'s that?\\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. I mean the Lord Protector.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Lord protect him from that kingly\\r\\n    title!\\r\\n    Hath he set bounds between their love and me?\\r\\n    I am their mother; who shall bar me from them?\\r\\n  DUCHESS. I am their father\\'s mother; I will see them.\\r\\n  ANNE. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.\\r\\n    Then bring me to their sights; I\\'ll bear thy blame,\\r\\n    And take thy office from thee on my peril. \\r\\n  BRAKENBURY. No, madam, no. I may not leave it so;\\r\\n    I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.            Exit\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Enter STANLEY\\r\\n\\r\\n  STANLEY. Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,\\r\\n    And I\\'ll salute your Grace of York as mother\\r\\n    And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.\\r\\n    [To ANNE]  Come, madam, you must straight to\\r\\n    Westminster,\\r\\n    There to be crowned Richard\\'s royal queen.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, cut my lace asunder\\r\\n    That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,\\r\\n    Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!\\r\\n  ANNE. Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!\\r\\n  DORSET. Be of good cheer; mother, how fares your Grace?\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee\\r\\n    gone!\\r\\n    Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels;\\r\\n    Thy mother\\'s name is ominous to children. \\r\\n    If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,\\r\\n    And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.\\r\\n    Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,\\r\\n    Lest thou increase the number of the dead,\\r\\n    And make me die the thrall of Margaret\\'s curse,\\r\\n    Nor mother, wife, nor England\\'s counted queen.\\r\\n  STANLEY. Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.\\r\\n    Take all the swift advantage of the hours;\\r\\n    You shall have letters from me to my son\\r\\n    In your behalf, to meet you on the way.\\r\\n    Be not ta\\'en tardy by unwise delay.\\r\\n  DUCHESS. O ill-dispersing wind of misery!\\r\\n    O my accursed womb, the bed of death!\\r\\n    A cockatrice hast thou hatch\\'d to the world,\\r\\n    Whose unavoided eye is murderous.\\r\\n  STANLEY. Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.\\r\\n  ANNE. And I with all unwillingness will go.\\r\\n    O, would to God that the inclusive verge\\r\\n    Of golden metal that must round my brow\\r\\n    Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains! \\r\\n    Anointed let me be with deadly venom,\\r\\n    And die ere men can say \\'God save the Queen!\\'\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Go, go, poor soul; I envy not thy glory.\\r\\n    To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.\\r\\n  ANNE. No, why? When he that is my husband now\\r\\n    Came to me, as I follow\\'d Henry\\'s corse;\\r\\n    When scarce the blood was well wash\\'d from his hands\\r\\n    Which issued from my other angel husband,\\r\\n    And that dear saint which then I weeping follow\\'d-\\r\\n    O, when, I say, I look\\'d on Richard\\'s face,\\r\\n    This was my wish: \\'Be thou\\' quoth I \\'accurs\\'d\\r\\n    For making me, so young, so old a widow;\\r\\n    And when thou wed\\'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;\\r\\n    And be thy wife, if any be so mad,\\r\\n    More miserable by the life of thee\\r\\n    Than thou hast made me by my dear lord\\'s death.\\'\\r\\n    Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,\\r\\n    Within so small a time, my woman\\'s heart\\r\\n    Grossly grew captive to his honey words\\r\\n    And prov\\'d the subject of mine own soul\\'s curse, \\r\\n    Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;\\r\\n    For never yet one hour in his bed\\r\\n    Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,\\r\\n    But with his timorous dreams was still awak\\'d.\\r\\n    Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;\\r\\n    And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.\\r\\n  ANNE. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.\\r\\n  DORSET. Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!\\r\\n  ANNE. Adieu, poor soul, that tak\\'st thy leave of it!\\r\\n  DUCHESS.  [To DORSET]  Go thou to Richmond, and good\\r\\n    fortune guide thee!\\r\\n    [To ANNE]  Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend\\r\\n    thee!  [To QUEEN ELIZABETH]  Go thou to sanctuary, and good\\r\\n    thoughts possess thee!\\r\\n    I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!\\r\\n    Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,\\r\\n    And each hour\\'s joy wreck\\'d with a week of teen.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Stay, yet look back with me unto the\\r\\n    Tower. \\r\\n    Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes\\r\\n    Whom envy hath immur\\'d within your walls,\\r\\n    Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.\\r\\n    Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow\\r\\n    For tender princes, use my babies well.\\r\\n    So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.         Exeunt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. The palace\\r\\n\\r\\nSound a sennet. Enter RICHARD, in pomp, as KING; BUCKINGHAM,\\r\\nCATESBY,\\r\\nRATCLIFF, LOVEL, a PAGE, and others\\r\\n\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham!\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. My gracious sovereign?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Give me thy hand.\\r\\n                           [Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound]\\r\\n    Thus high, by thy advice\\r\\n    And thy assistance, is King Richard seated.\\r\\n    But shall we wear these glories for a day;\\r\\n    Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Still live they, and for ever let them last!\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,\\r\\n    To try if thou be current gold indeed.\\r\\n    Young Edward lives-think now what I would speak.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Say on, my loving lord.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Why, Buckingham, I say I would be King.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord. \\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Ha! am I King? \\'Tis so; but Edward lives.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. True, noble Prince.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. O bitter consequence:\\r\\n    That Edward still should live-true noble Prince!\\r\\n    Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.\\r\\n    Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead.\\r\\n    And I would have it suddenly perform\\'d.\\r\\n    What say\\'st thou now? Speak suddenly, be brief.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace may do your pleasure.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.\\r\\n    Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Give me some little breath, some pause,\\r\\n    dear Lord,\\r\\n    Before I positively speak in this.\\r\\n    I will resolve you herein presently.                    Exit\\r\\n  CATESBY.  [Aside to another]  The King is angry; see, he\\r\\n    gnaws his lip.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. I will converse with iron-witted fools\\r\\n                                      [Descends from the throne]\\r\\n    And unrespective boys; none are for me \\r\\n    That look into me with considerate eyes.\\r\\n    High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.\\r\\n    Boy!\\r\\n  PAGE. My lord?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Know\\'st thou not any whom corrupting\\r\\n    gold\\r\\n    Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?\\r\\n  PAGE. I know a discontented gentleman\\r\\n    Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.\\r\\n    Gold were as good as twenty orators,\\r\\n    And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. What is his name?\\r\\n  PAGE. His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. I partly know the man. Go, call him hither,\\r\\n    boy.                                               Exit PAGE\\r\\n    The deep-revolving witty Buckingham\\r\\n    No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels.\\r\\n    Hath he so long held out with me, untir\\'d,\\r\\n    And stops he now for breath?

I say again, give out\\r\\n    That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die.\\r\\n    About it; for it stands me much upon\\r\\n    To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.\\r\\n                                                    Exit CATESBY\\r\\n    I must be married to my brother\\'s daughter,\\r\\n    Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.\\r\\n    Murder her brothers, and then marry her! \\r\\n    Uncertain way of gain!

Dar\\'st\\'thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?\\r\\n  TYRREL. Please you;\\r\\n    But I had rather kill two enemies.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Why, then thou hast it. Two deep enemies,\\r\\n    Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep\\'s disturbers,\\r\\n    Are they that I would have thee deal upon.\\r\\n  TYRREL, I mean those bastards in the Tower.\\r\\n  TYRREL.

Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey \\r\\n    Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. What says your Highness to my just request?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. I do remember me: Henry the Sixth\\r\\n    Did prophesy that Richmond should be King,\\r\\n    When Richmond was a little peevish boy.\\r\\n    A king!-perhaps-\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord-\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. How chance the prophet could not at that\\r\\n    time\\r\\n    Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom-\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,\\r\\n    The mayor in courtesy show\\'d me the castle\\r\\n    And call\\'d it Rugemount, at which name I started,\\r\\n    Because a bard of Ireland told me once\\r\\n    I should not live long after I saw Richmond.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord-\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, what\\'s o\\'clock?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind\\r\\n    Of what you promis\\'d me. \\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Well, but o\\'clock?\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Upon the stroke of ten.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Well, let it strike.\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM. Why let it strike?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD.

May it please you to resolve me in my suit.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.\\r\\n                                       Exeunt all but Buckingham\\r\\n  BUCKINGHAM.

That thou dost love my daughter from\\r\\n      thy soul.\\r\\n    So from thy soul\\'s love didst thou love her brothers,\\r\\n    And from my heart\\'s love I do thank thee for it.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.\\r\\n    I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter\\r\\n    And do intend to make her Queen of England.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be\\r\\n    her king?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Even he that makes her Queen. Who else\\r\\n    should be?\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What, thou?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Even so. How think you of it?\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. How canst thou woo her?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. That would I learn of you,\\r\\n    As one being best acquainted with her humour.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And wilt thou learn of me?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Madam, with all my heart.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Send to her, by the man that slew her \\r\\n    brothers,\\r\\n    A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave\\r\\n    \\'Edward\\' and \\'York.\\' Then haply will she weep;\\r\\n    Therefore present to her-as sometimes Margaret\\r\\n    Did to thy father, steep\\'d in Rutland\\'s blood-\\r\\n    A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain\\r\\n    The purple sap from her sweet brother\\'s body,\\r\\n    And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.\\r\\n    If this inducement move her not to love,\\r\\n    Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;\\r\\n    Tell her thou mad\\'st away her uncle Clarence,\\r\\n    Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake\\r\\n    Mad\\'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. You mock me, madam; this is not the way\\r\\n    To win your daughter.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. There is no other way;\\r\\n    Unless thou couldst put on some other shape\\r\\n    And not be Richard that hath done all this.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Say that I did all this for love of her.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but \\r\\n      hate thee,\\r\\n    Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Look what is done cannot be now amended.\\r\\n    Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,\\r\\n    Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.\\r\\n    If I did take the kingdom from your sons,\\r\\n    To make amends I\\'ll give it to your daughter.\\r\\n    If I have kill\\'d the issue of your womb,\\r\\n    To quicken your increase I will beget\\r\\n    Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.\\r\\n    A grandam\\'s name is little less in love\\r\\n    Than is the doating title of a mother;\\r\\n    They are as children but one step below,\\r\\n    Even of your metal, of your very blood;\\r\\n    Of all one pain, save for a night of groans\\r\\n    Endur\\'d of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.\\r\\n    Your children were vexation to your youth;\\r\\n    But mine shall be a comfort to your age.\\r\\n    The loss you have is but a son being King,\\r\\n    And by that loss your daughter is made Queen. \\r\\n    I cannot make you what amends I would,\\r\\n    Therefore accept such kindness as I can.\\r\\n    Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul\\r\\n    Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,\\r\\n    This fair alliance quickly shall can home\\r\\n    To high promotions and great dignity.\\r\\n    The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,\\r\\n    Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;\\r\\n    Again shall you be mother to a king,\\r\\n    And all the ruins of distressful times\\r\\n    Repair\\'d with double riches of content.\\r\\n    What! we have many goodly days to see.\\r\\n    The liquid drops of tears that you have shed\\r\\n    Shall come again, transform\\'d to orient pearl,\\r\\n    Advantaging their loan with interest\\r\\n    Of ten times double gain of happiness.\\r\\n    Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go;\\r\\n    Make bold her bashful years with your experience;\\r\\n    Prepare her ears to hear a wooer\\'s tale;\\r\\n    Put in her tender heart th\\' aspiring flame \\r\\n    Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princes\\r\\n    With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys.\\r\\n    And when this arm of mine hath chastised\\r\\n    The petty rebel, dull-brain\\'d Buckingham,\\r\\n    Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,\\r\\n    And lead thy daughter to a conqueror\\'s bed;\\r\\n    To whom I will retail my conquest won,\\r\\n    And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar\\'s Caesar.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What were I best to say? Her father\\'s\\r\\n      brother\\r\\n    Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?\\r\\n    Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?\\r\\n    Under what title shall I woo for thee\\r\\n    That God, the law, my honour, and her love\\r\\n    Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Infer fair England\\'s peace by this alliance.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Which she shall purchase with\\r\\n    still-lasting war.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Tell her the King, that may command,\\r\\n    entreats. \\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That at her hands which the King\\'s\\r\\n    King forbids.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To wail the title, as her mother doth.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Say I will love her everlastingly.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long shall that title \\'ever\\' last?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Sweetly in force unto her fair life\\'s end.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long fairly shall her sweet life\\r\\n    last?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As long as hell and Richard likes of it.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But she, your subject, loathes such\\r\\n    sovereignty.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Be eloquent in my behalf to her.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. An honest tale speeds best being plainly\\r\\n    told.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Your reasons are too shallow and too quick. \\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, no, my reasons are too deep and\\r\\n      dead-\\r\\n    Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings\\r\\n    break.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Now, by my George, my garter, and my\\r\\n    crown-\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Profan\\'d, dishonour\\'d, and the third\\r\\n    usurp\\'d.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. I swear-\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. By nothing; for this is no oath:\\r\\n    Thy George, profan\\'d, hath lost his lordly honour;\\r\\n    Thy garter, blemish\\'d, pawn\\'d his knightly virtue;\\r\\n    Thy crown, usurp\\'d, disgrac\\'d his kingly glory.\\r\\n    If something thou wouldst swear to be believ\\'d,\\r\\n    Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong\\'d.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Then, by my self-\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy self is self-misus\\'d.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Now, by the world- \\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. \\'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. My father\\'s death-\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy life hath it dishonour\\'d.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Why, then, by God-\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. God\\'s wrong is most of all.\\r\\n    If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,\\r\\n    The unity the King my husband made\\r\\n    Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.\\r\\n    If thou hadst fear\\'d to break an oath by Him,\\r\\n    Th\\' imperial metal, circling now thy head,\\r\\n    Had grac\\'d the tender temples of my child;\\r\\n    And both the Princes had been breathing here,\\r\\n    Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,\\r\\n    Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.\\r\\n    What canst thou swear by now?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. The time to come.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou hast wronged in the time\\r\\n    o\\'erpast;\\r\\n    For I myself have many tears to wash\\r\\n    Hereafter time, for time past wrong\\'d by thee. \\r\\n    The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter\\'d,\\r\\n    Ungovern\\'d youth, to wail it in their age;\\r\\n    The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed,\\r\\n    Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.\\r\\n    Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast\\r\\n    Misus\\'d ere us\\'d, by times ill-us\\'d o\\'erpast.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. As I intend to prosper and repent,\\r\\n    So thrive I in my dangerous affairs\\r\\n    Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound!\\r\\n    Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!\\r\\n    Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!\\r\\n    Be opposite all planets of good luck\\r\\n    To my proceeding!-if, with dear heart\\'s love,\\r\\n    Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,\\r\\n    I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.\\r\\n    In her consists my happiness and thine;\\r\\n    Without her, follows to myself and thee,\\r\\n    Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,\\r\\n    Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.\\r\\n    It cannot be avoided but by this; \\r\\n    It will not be avoided but by this.\\r\\n    Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so-\\r\\n    Be the attorney of my love to her;\\r\\n    Plead what I will be, not what I have been;\\r\\n    Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.\\r\\n    Urge the necessity and state of times,\\r\\n    And be not peevish-fond in great designs.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I forget myself to be myself?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, if your self\\'s remembrance wrong\\r\\n    yourself.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Yet thou didst kill my children.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. But in your daughter\\'s womb I bury them;\\r\\n    Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed\\r\\n    Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. And be a happy mother by the deed.\\r\\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I go. Write to me very shortly,\\r\\n    And you shall understand from me her mind. \\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Bear her my true love\\'s kiss; and so, farewell.\\r\\n                               Kissing her. Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH\\r\\n    Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!\\r\\n\\r\\n                 Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following\\r\\n\\r\\n    How now! what news?\\r\\n  RATCLIFF. Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast\\r\\n    Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores\\r\\n    Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,\\r\\n    Unarm\\'d, and unresolv\\'d to beat them back.\\r\\n    \\'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;\\r\\n    And there they hull, expecting but the aid\\r\\n    Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of\\r\\n    Norfolk.\\r\\n    Ratcliff, thyself-or Catesby; where is he?\\r\\n  CATESBY. Here, my good lord.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Catesby, fly to the Duke.\\r\\n  CATESBY. I will my lord, with all convenient haste. \\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Ratcliff, come hither. Post to Salisbury;\\r\\n    When thou com\\'st thither-  [To CATESBY]  Dull,\\r\\n    unmindfull villain,\\r\\n    Why stay\\'st thou here, and go\\'st not to the Duke?\\r\\n  CATESBY. First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness\\' pleasure,\\r\\n    What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight\\r\\n    The greatest strength and power that he can make\\r\\n    And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.\\r\\n  CATESBY. I go.                                            Exit\\r\\n  RATCLIFF. What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Why, what wouldst thou do there before I\\r\\n    go?\\r\\n  RATCLIFF. Your Highness told me I should post before.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. My mind is chang\\'d.\\r\\n\\r\\n                           Enter LORD STANLEY\\r\\n\\r\\n  STANLEY, what news with you?\\r\\n  STANLEY. None good, my liege, to please you with \\r\\n    the hearing;\\r\\n    Nor none so bad but well may be reported.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!\\r\\n    What need\\'st thou run so many miles about,\\r\\n    When thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way?\\r\\n    Once more, what news?\\r\\n  STANLEY. Richmond is on the seas.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. There let him sink, and be the seas on him!\\r\\n    White-liver\\'d runagate, what doth he there?\\r\\n  STANLEY. I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Well, as you guess?\\r\\n  STANLEY. Stirr\\'d up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,\\r\\n    He makes for England here to claim the crown.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway\\'d?\\r\\n    Is the King dead, the empire unpossess\\'d?\\r\\n    What heir of York is there alive but we?\\r\\n    And who is England\\'s King but great York\\'s heir?\\r\\n    Then tell me what makes he upon the seas.\\r\\n  STANLEY. Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Unless for that he comes to be your liege, \\r\\n    You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.\\r\\n    Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.\\r\\n  STANLEY. No, my good lord; therefore mistrust me not.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Where is thy power then, to beat him back?\\r\\n    Where be thy tenants and thy followers?\\r\\n    Are they not now upon the western shore,\\r\\n    Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?\\r\\n  STANLEY. No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Cold friends to me. What do they in the\\r\\n    north,\\r\\n    When they should serve their sovereign in the west?\\r\\n  STANLEY. They have not been commanded, mighty King.\\r\\n    Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave,\\r\\n    I\\'ll muster up my friends and meet your Grace\\r\\n    Where and what time your Majesty shall please.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with\\r\\n    Richmond;\\r\\n    But I\\'ll not trust thee.\\r\\n  STANLEY. Most mighty sovereign,\\r\\n    You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful. \\r\\n    I never was nor never will be false.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Go, then, and muster men. But leave behind\\r\\n    Your son, George Stanley. Look your heart be firm,\\r\\n    Or else his head\\'s assurance is but frail.\\r\\n  STANLEY. So deal with him as I prove true to you.         Exit\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Enter a MESSENGER\\r\\n\\r\\n  MESSENGER.

[He strikes him]\\r\\n    There, take thou that till thou bring better news.\\r\\n  THIRD MESSENGER. The news I have to tell your Majesty\\r\\n    Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters\\r\\n    Buckingham\\'s army is dispers\\'d and scatter\\'d;\\r\\n    And he himself wand\\'red away alone,\\r\\n    No man knows whither.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. I cry thee mercy.\\r\\n    There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.\\r\\n    Hath any well-advised friend proclaim\\'d\\r\\n    Reward to him that brings the traitor in?\\r\\n  THIRD MESSENGER.

He, mistrusting them,\\r\\n    Hois\\'d sail, and made his course again for Britaine.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. March on, march on, since we are up in\\r\\n    arms;\\r\\n    If not to fight with foreign enemies,\\r\\n    Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Re-enter CATESBY\\r\\n\\r\\n  CATESBY. My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken- \\r\\n    That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond\\r\\n    Is with a mighty power landed at Milford\\r\\n    Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.\\r\\n  KING RICHARD. Away towards Salisbury! While we reason\\r\\n    here\\r\\n    A royal battle might be won and lost.\\r\\n    Some one take order Buckingham be brought\\r\\n    To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.\\r\\n    Flourish.

The\\r\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\r\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\r\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\\r\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\\r\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\r\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\r\\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\\r\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\\r\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\r\\nfrom Michael Hart\\'s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\r\\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\r\\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\\r\\ndon\\'t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\r\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Who\\'s there?\\r\\n  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold\\r\\nyour selfe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bar. Long liue the King\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\r\\nor letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the\\r\\noriginal meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\r\\nto unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions\\r\\nthat look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\r\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming\\r\\nShakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is that they MAY have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a\\r\\ntime when they were out of \"v\"\\'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in\\r\\nplace of some \"w\"\\'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,\\r\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn\\'t want to spend\\r\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as I\\r\\nhave mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an\\r\\nextreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\r\\nvery high place in the \"canon\" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\\r\\nassortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University\\r\\nin England for several months in a glass room constructed for the\\r\\npurpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available\\r\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,\\r\\nthat Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a\\r\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\r\\nfor signing his name with several different spellings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, please take this into account when reading the comments below\\r\\nmade by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\r\\nthat are \"not\" errors. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nSo. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\\r\\nhere is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare\\'s The Life of \\r\\nHenry the Fift.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael S. Hart\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\r\\nExecutive Director\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScanner\\'s Notes: What this is and isn\\'t.  This was taken from\\r\\na copy of Shakespeare\\'s first folio and it is as close as I can \\r\\ncome in ASCII to the printed text.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elongated S\\'s have been changed to small s\\'s and the\\r\\nconjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\\r\\npunctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the\\r\\nprinted text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put\\r\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the\\r\\nGeneva Bible and Shakespeare\\'s First Folio and have unified\\r\\nspellings according to this template), typo\\'s and expanded\\r\\nabbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within\\r\\nbrackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don\\'t like that\\r\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets if you want a\\r\\npurer Shakespeare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual\\r\\ndifferences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may\\r\\nbe differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between\\r\\nthis and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer\\'s\\r\\nhabit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and\\r\\nthen proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then\\r\\ncontinuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn\\'t thrown away but\\r\\nincorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.\\r\\nThe text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different\\r\\nFirst Folio editions\\' best pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\\r\\nerrors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\\r\\nfree to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best\\r\\netext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com\\r\\nand davidr@inconnect.com.

Then heare me gracious Soueraign, & you Peers,\\r\\nThat owe your selues, your liues, and seruices,\\r\\nTo this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre\\r\\nTo make against your Highnesse Clayme to France,\\r\\nBut this which they produce from Pharamond,\\r\\nIn terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant,\\r\\nNo Woman shall succeed in Salike Land:\\r\\nWhich Salike Land, the French vniustly gloze\\r\\nTo be the Realme of France, and Pharamond\\r\\nThe founder of this Law, and Female Barre.\\r\\nYet their owne Authors faithfully affirme,\\r\\nThat the Land Salike is in Germanie,\\r\\nBetweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue:\\r\\nWhere Charles the Great hauing subdu\\'d the Saxons,\\r\\nThere left behind and settled certaine French:\\r\\nWho holding in disdaine the German Women,\\r\\nFor some dishonest manners of their life,\\r\\nEstablisht then this Law; to wit, No Female\\r\\nShould be Inheritrix in Salike Land:\\r\\nWhich Salike (as I said) \\'twixt Elue and Sala,\\r\\nIs at this day in Germanie, call\\'d Meisen.\\r\\nThen doth it well appeare, the Salike Law\\r\\nWas not deuised for the Realme of France:\\r\\nNor did the French possesse the Salike Land,\\r\\nVntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres\\r\\nAfter defunction of King Pharamond,\\r\\nIdly suppos\\'d the founder of this Law,\\r\\nWho died within the yeere of our Redemption,\\r\\nFoure hundred twentie six: and Charles the Great\\r\\nSubdu\\'d the Saxons, and did seat the French\\r\\nBeyond the Riuer Sala, in the yeere\\r\\nEight hundred fiue. Besides, their Writers say,\\r\\nKing Pepin, which deposed Childerike,\\r\\nDid as Heire Generall, being descended\\r\\nOf Blithild, which was Daughter to King Clothair,\\r\\nMake Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France.\\r\\nHugh Capet also, who vsurpt the Crowne\\r\\nOf Charles the Duke of Loraine, sole Heire male\\r\\nOf the true Line and Stock of Charles the Great:\\r\\nTo find his Title with some shewes of truth,\\r\\nThough in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,\\r\\nConuey\\'d himselfe as th\\' Heire to th\\' Lady Lingare,\\r\\nDaughter to Charlemaine, who was the Sonne\\r\\nTo Lewes the Emperour, and Lewes the Sonne\\r\\nOf Charles the Great: also King Lewes the Tenth,\\r\\nWho was sole Heire to the Vsurper Capet,\\r\\nCould not keepe quiet in his conscience,\\r\\nWearing the Crowne of France, \\'till satisfied,\\r\\nThat faire Queene Isabel, his Grandmother,\\r\\nWas Lineall of the Lady Ermengare,\\r\\nDaughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Loraine:\\r\\nBy the which Marriage, the Lyne of Charles the Great\\r\\nWas re-vnited to the Crowne of France.\\r\\nSo, that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne,\\r\\nKing Pepins Title, and Hugh Capets Clayme,\\r\\nKing Lewes his satisfaction, all appeare\\r\\nTo hold in Right and Title of the Female:\\r\\nSo doe the Kings of France vnto this day.\\r\\nHowbeit, they would hold vp this Salique Law,\\r\\nTo barre your Highnesse clayming from the Female,\\r\\nAnd rather chuse to hide them in a Net,\\r\\nThen amply to imbarre their crooked Titles,\\r\\nVsurpt from you and your Progenitors\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. May I with right and conscience make this claim?\\r\\n  Bish.Cant.

Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth\\r\\nDoe all expect, that you should rowse your selfe,\\r\\nAs did the former Lyons of your Blood\\r\\n\\r\\n   West.

We must not onely arme t\\' inuade the French,\\r\\nBut lay downe our proportions, to defend\\r\\nAgainst the Scot, who will make roade vpon vs,\\r\\nWith all aduantages\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bish.Can.

We do not meane the coursing snatchers onely,\\r\\nBut feare the maine intendment of the Scot,\\r\\nWho hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs:\\r\\nFor you shall reade, that my great Grandfather\\r\\nNeuer went with his forces into France,\\r\\nBut that the Scot, on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,\\r\\nCame pouring like the Tyde into a breach,\\r\\nWith ample and brim fulnesse of his force,\\r\\nGalling the gleaned Land with hot Assayes,\\r\\nGirding with grieuous siege, Castles and Townes:\\r\\nThat England being emptie of defence,\\r\\nHath shooke and trembled at th\\' ill neighbourhood\\r\\n\\r\\n   B.Can. She hath bin the[n] more fear\\'d the[n] harm\\'d, my Liege:\\r\\nFor heare her but exampl\\'d by her selfe,\\r\\nWhen all her Cheualrie hath been in France,\\r\\nAnd shee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles,\\r\\nShee hath her selfe not onely well defended,\\r\\nBut taken and impounded as a Stray,\\r\\nThe King of Scots: whom shee did send to France,\\r\\nTo fill King Edwards fame with prisoner Kings,\\r\\nAnd make their Chronicle as rich with prayse,\\r\\nAs is the Owse and bottome of the Sea\\r\\nWith sunken Wrack, and sum-lesse Treasuries\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bish.Ely. But there\\'s a saying very old and true,\\r\\nIf that you will France win, then with Scotland first begin.\\r\\nFor once the Eagle (England) being in prey,\\r\\nTo her vnguarded Nest, the Weazell (Scot)\\r\\nComes sneaking, and so sucks her Princely Egges,\\r\\nPlaying the Mouse in absence of the Cat,\\r\\nTo tame and hauocke more then she can eate\\r\\n\\r\\n   Exet. It followes then, the Cat must stay at home,\\r\\nYet that is but a crush\\'d necessity,\\r\\nSince we haue lockes to safegard necessaries,\\r\\nAnd pretty traps to catch the petty theeues.\\r\\nWhile that the Armed hand doth fight abroad,\\r\\nTh\\' aduised head defends it selfe at home:\\r\\nFor Gouernment, though high, and low, and lower,\\r\\nPut into parts, doth keepe in one consent,\\r\\nCongreeing in a full and natural close,\\r\\nLike Musicke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Cant. Therefore doth heauen diuide\\r\\nThe state of man in diuers functions,\\r\\nSetting endeuour in continual motion:\\r\\nTo which is fixed as an ayme or butt,\\r\\nObedience: for so worke the Hony Bees,\\r\\nCreatures that by a rule in Nature teach\\r\\nThe Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome.\\r\\nThey haue a King, and Officers of sorts,\\r\\nWhere some like Magistrates correct at home:\\r\\nOthers, like Merchants venter Trade abroad:\\r\\nOthers, like Souldiers armed in their stings,\\r\\nMake boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes:\\r\\nWhich pillage, they with merry march bring home\\r\\nTo the Tent-royal of their Emperor:\\r\\nWho busied in his Maiesties surueyes\\r\\nThe singing Masons building roofes of Gold,\\r\\nThe ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony;\\r\\nThe poore Mechanicke Porters, crowding in\\r\\nTheir heauy burthens at his narrow gate:\\r\\nThe sad-ey\\'d Iustice with his surly humme,\\r\\nDeliuering ore to Executors pale\\r\\nThe lazie yawning Drone: I this inferre,\\r\\nThat many things hauing full reference\\r\\nTo one consent, may worke contrariously,\\r\\nAs many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes\\r\\nCome to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne,\\r\\nAs many fresh streames meet in one salt sea;\\r\\nAs many Lynes close in the Dials center:\\r\\nSo may a thousand actions once a foote,\\r\\nAnd in one purpose, and be all well borne\\r\\nWithout defeat. Therefore to France, my Liege,\\r\\nDiuide your happy England into foure,\\r\\nWhereof, take you one quarter into France,\\r\\nAnd you withall shall make all Gallia shake.\\r\\nIf we with thrice such powers left at home,\\r\\nCannot defend our owne doores from the dogge,\\r\\nLet vs be worried, and our Nation lose\\r\\nThe name of hardinesse and policie\\r\\n\\r\\n   King.

They shall be apprehended by and by\\r\\n\\r\\n   West. How smooth and euen they do bear themselues,\\r\\nAs if allegeance in their bosomes sate\\r\\nCrowned with faith, and constant loyalty\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bed. The King hath note of all that they intend,\\r\\nBy interception, which they dreame not of\\r\\n\\r\\n   Exe. Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,\\r\\nWhom he hath dull\\'d and cloy\\'d with gracious fauours;\\r\\nThat he should for a forraigne purse, so sell\\r\\nHis Soueraignes life to death and treachery.\\r\\n\\r\\nSound Trumpets.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter the King, Scroope, Cambridge, and Gray.\\r\\n\\r\\n  King. Now sits the winde faire, and we will aboord.\\r\\nMy Lord of Cambridge, and my kinde Lord of Masham,\\r\\nAnd you my gentle Knight, giue me your thoughts:\\r\\nThinke you not that the powres we beare with vs\\r\\nWill cut their passage through the force of France?\\r\\nDoing the execution, and the acte,\\r\\nFor which we haue in head assembled them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Scro. No doubt my Liege, if each man do his best\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. I doubt not that, since we are well perswaded\\r\\nWe carry not a heart with vs from hence,\\r\\nThat growes not in a faire consent with ours:\\r\\nNor leaue not one behinde, that doth not wish\\r\\nSuccesse and Conquest to attend on vs\\r\\n\\r\\n   Cam. Neuer was Monarch better fear\\'d and lou\\'d,\\r\\nThen is your Maiesty; there\\'s not I thinke a subiect\\r\\nThat sits in heart-greefe and vneasinesse\\r\\nVnder the sweet shade of your gouernment\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kni. True: those that were your Fathers enemies,\\r\\nHaue steep\\'d their gauls in hony, and do serue you\\r\\nWith hearts create of duty, and of zeale\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. We therefore haue great cause of thankfulnes,\\r\\nAnd shall forget the office of our hand\\r\\nSooner then quittance of desert and merit,\\r\\nAccording to the weight and worthinesse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Scro. So seruice shall with steeled sinewes toyle,\\r\\nAnd labour shall refresh it selfe with hope\\r\\nTo do your Grace incessant seruices\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. We Iudge no lesse. Vnkle of Exeter,\\r\\nInlarge the man committed yesterday,\\r\\nThat rayl\\'d against our person: We consider\\r\\nIt was excesse of Wine that set him on,\\r\\nAnd on his more aduice, We pardon him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Scro. That\\'s mercy, but too much security:\\r\\nLet him be punish\\'d Soueraigne, least example\\r\\nBreed (by his sufferance) more of such a kind\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. O let vs yet be mercifull\\r\\n\\r\\n   Cam. So may your Highnesse, and yet punish too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Grey. Sir, you shew great mercy if you giue him life,\\r\\nAfter the taste of much correction\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Alas, your too much loue and care of me,\\r\\nAre heauy Orisons \\'gainst this poore wretch:\\r\\nIf little faults proceeding on distemper,\\r\\nShall not be wink\\'d at, how shall we stretch our eye\\r\\nWhen capitall crimes, chew\\'d, swallow\\'d, and digested,\\r\\nAppeare before vs? Wee\\'l yet inlarge that man,\\r\\nThough Cambridge, Scroope, and Gray, in their deere care\\r\\nAnd tender preseruation of our person\\r\\nWold haue him punish\\'d. And now to our French causes,\\r\\nWho are the late Commissioners?\\r\\n  Cam. I one my Lord,\\r\\nYour Highnesse bad me aske for it to day\\r\\n\\r\\n   Scro. So did you me my Liege\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gray. And I my Royall Soueraigne\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Then Richard Earle of Cambridge, there is yours:\\r\\nThere yours Lord Scroope of Masham, and Sir Knight:\\r\\nGray of Northumberland, this same is yours:\\r\\nReade them, and know I know your worthinesse.\\r\\nMy Lord of Westmerland, and Vnkle Exeter,\\r\\nWe will aboord to night. Why how now Gentlemen?\\r\\nWhat see you in those papers, that you loose\\r\\nSo much complexion? Looke ye how they change:\\r\\nTheir cheekes are paper. Why, what reade you there,\\r\\nThat haue so cowarded and chac\\'d your blood\\r\\nOut of apparance\\r\\n\\r\\n   Cam. I do confesse my fault,\\r\\nAnd do submit me to your Highnesse mercy\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gray. Scro. To which we all appeale\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. The mercy that was quicke in vs but late,\\r\\nBy your owne counsaile is supprest and kill\\'d:\\r\\nYou must not dare (for shame) to talke of mercy,\\r\\nFor your owne reasons turne into your bosomes,\\r\\nAs dogs vpon their maisters, worrying you:\\r\\nSee you my Princes, and my Noble Peeres,\\r\\nThese English monsters: My Lord of Cambridge heere,\\r\\nYou know how apt our loue was, to accord\\r\\nTo furnish with all appertinents\\r\\nBelonging to his Honour; and this man,\\r\\nHath for a few light Crownes, lightly conspir\\'d\\r\\nAnd sworne vnto the practises of France\\r\\nTo kill vs heere in Hampton. To the which,\\r\\nThis Knight no lesse for bounty bound to Vs\\r\\nThen Cambridge is, hath likewise sworne. But O,\\r\\nWhat shall I say to thee Lord Scroope, thou cruell,\\r\\nIngratefull, sauage, and inhumane Creature?\\r\\nThou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes,\\r\\nThat knew\\'st the very bottome of my soule,\\r\\nThat (almost) might\\'st haue coyn\\'d me into Golde,\\r\\nWould\\'st thou haue practis\\'d on me, for thy vse?\\r\\nMay it be possible, that forraigne hyer\\r\\nCould out of thee extract one sparke of euill\\r\\nThat might annoy my finger? \\'Tis so strange,\\r\\nThat though the truth of it stands off as grosse\\r\\nAs black and white, my eye will scarsely see it.\\r\\nTreason, and murther, euer kept together,\\r\\nAs two yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose,\\r\\nWorking so grossely in an naturall cause,\\r\\nThat admiration did not hoope at them.\\r\\nBut thou (gainst all proportion) didst bring in\\r\\nWonder to waite on treason, and on murther:\\r\\nAnd whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was\\r\\nThat wrought vpon thee so preposterously,\\r\\nHath got the voyce in hell for excellence:\\r\\nAnd other diuels that suggest by treasons,\\r\\nDo botch and bungle vp damnation,\\r\\nWith patches, colours, and with formes being fetcht\\r\\nFrom glist\\'ring semblances of piety:\\r\\nBut he that temper\\'d thee, bad thee stand vp,\\r\\nGaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,\\r\\nVnlesse to dub thee with the name of Traitor.\\r\\nIf that same Daemon that hath gull\\'d thee thus,\\r\\nShould with his Lyon-gate walke the whole world,\\r\\nHe might returne to vastie Tartar backe,\\r\\nAnd tell the Legions, I can neuer win\\r\\nA soule so easie as that Englishmans.\\r\\nOh, how hast thou with iealousie infected\\r\\nThe sweetnesse of affiance? Shew men dutifull,\\r\\nWhy so didst thou: seeme they graue and learned?\\r\\nWhy so didst thou. Come they of Noble Family?\\r\\nWhy so didst thou. Seeme they religious?\\r\\nWhy so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,\\r\\nFree from grosse passion, or of mirth, or anger,\\r\\nConstant in spirit, not sweruing with the blood,\\r\\nGarnish\\'d and deck\\'d in modest complement,\\r\\nNot working with the eye, without the eare,\\r\\nAnd but in purged iudgement trusting neither,\\r\\nSuch and so finely boulted didst thou seeme:\\r\\nAnd thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot,\\r\\nTo make thee full fraught man, and best indued\\r\\nWith some suspition, I will weepe for thee.\\r\\nFor this reuolt of thine, me thinkes is like\\r\\nAnother fall of Man. Their faults are open,\\r\\nArrest them to the answer of the Law,\\r\\nAnd God acquit them of their practises\\r\\n\\r\\n   Exe. I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of\\r\\nRichard Earle of Cambridge.\\r\\nI arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas\\r\\nLord Scroope of Marsham.\\r\\nI arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas\\r\\nGrey, Knight of Northumberland\\r\\n\\r\\n   Scro. Our purposes, God iustly hath discouer\\'d,\\r\\nAnd I repent my fault more then my death,\\r\\nWhich I beseech your Highnesse to forgiue,\\r\\nAlthough my body pay the price of it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Cam. For me, the Gold of France did not seduce,\\r\\nAlthough I did admit it as a motiue,\\r\\nThe sooner to effect what I intended:\\r\\nBut God be thanked for preuention,\\r\\nWhich in sufferance heartily will reioyce,\\r\\nBeseeching God, and you, to pardon mee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gray. Neuer did faithfull subiect more reioyce\\r\\nAt the discouery of most dangerous Treason,\\r\\nThen I do at this houre ioy ore my selfe,\\r\\nPreuented from a damned enterprize;\\r\\nMy fault, but not my body, pardon Soueraigne\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. God quit you in his mercy: Hear your sentence\\r\\nYou haue conspir\\'d against Our Royall person,\\r\\nIoyn\\'d with an enemy proclaim\\'d, and from his Coffers,\\r\\nReceyu\\'d the Golden Earnest of Our death:\\r\\nWherein you would haue sold your King to slaughter,\\r\\nHis Princes, and his Peeres to seruitude,\\r\\nHis Subiects to oppression, and contempt,\\r\\nAnd his whole Kingdome into desolation:\\r\\nTouching our person, seeke we no reuenge,\\r\\nBut we our Kingdomes safety must so tender,\\r\\nWhose ruine you sought, that to her Lawes\\r\\nWe do deliuer you. Get you therefore hence,\\r\\n(Poore miserable wretches) to your death:\\r\\nThe taste whereof, God of his mercy giue\\r\\nYou patience to indure, and true Repentance\\r\\nOf all your deare offences. Beare them hence.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Lords for France: the enterprise whereof\\r\\nShall be to you as vs, like glorious.\\r\\nWe doubt not of a faire and luckie Warre,\\r\\nSince God so graciously hath brought to light\\r\\nThis dangerous Treason, lurking in our way,\\r\\nTo hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now,\\r\\nBut euery Rubbe is smoothed on our way.\\r\\nThen forth, deare Countreymen: Let vs deliuer\\r\\nOur Puissance into the hand of God,\\r\\nPutting it straight in expedition.\\r\\nChearely to Sea, the signes of Warre aduance,\\r\\nNo King of England, if not King of France.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlourish.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Pistoll, Nim, Bardolph, Boy, and Hostesse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Hostesse. \\'Prythee honey sweet Husband, let me bring\\r\\nthee to Staines\\r\\n\\r\\n   Pistoll.

Nay sure, hee\\'s not in Hell: hee\\'s in Arthurs\\r\\nBosome, if euer man went to Arthurs Bosome: a made a\\r\\nfiner end, and went away and it had beene any Christome\\r\\nChilde: a parted eu\\'n iust betweene Twelue and One, eu\\'n\\r\\nat the turning o\\'th\\' Tyde: for after I saw him fumble with\\r\\nthe Sheets, and play with Flowers, and smile vpon his fingers\\r\\nend, I knew there was but one way: for his Nose was\\r\\nas sharpe as a Pen, and a Table of greene fields. How now\\r\\nSir Iohn (quoth I?) what man? be a good cheare: so a\\r\\ncryed out, God, God, God, three or foure times: now I,\\r\\nto comfort him, bid him a should not thinke of God; I\\r\\nhop\\'d there was no neede to trouble himselfe with any\\r\\nsuch thoughts yet: so a bad me lay more Clothes on his\\r\\nfeet: I put my hand into the Bed, and felt them, and they\\r\\nwere as cold as any stone: then I felt to his knees, and so\\r\\nvp-peer\\'d, and vpward, and all was as cold as any stone\\r\\n\\r\\n   Nim.

And I: If wishes would preuayle with me, my\\r\\npurpose should not fayle with me; but thither would I\\r\\nhigh\\r\\n\\r\\n   Boy.

Be mercifull great Duke to men of Mould: abate\\r\\nthy Rage, abate thy manly Rage; abate thy Rage,\\r\\ngreat Duke. Good Bawcock bate thy Rage: vse lenitie\\r\\nsweet Chuck\\r\\n\\r\\n   Nim. These be good humors: your Honor wins bad\\r\\nhumors.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Boy. As young as I am, I haue obseru\\'d these three\\r\\nSwashers: I am Boy to them all three, but all they three,\\r\\nthough they would serue me, could not be Man to me;\\r\\nfor indeed three such Antiques doe not amount to a man:\\r\\nfor Bardolph, hee is white-liuer\\'d, and red-fac\\'d; by the\\r\\nmeanes whereof, a faces it out, but fights not: for Pistoll,\\r\\nhee hath a killing Tongue, and a quiet Sword; by the\\r\\nmeanes whereof, a breakes Words, and keepes whole\\r\\nWeapons: for Nim, hee hath heard, that men of few\\r\\nWords are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say\\r\\nhis Prayers, lest a should be thought a Coward: but his\\r\\nfew bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for\\r\\na neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was\\r\\nagainst a Post, when he was drunke. They will steale any\\r\\nthing, and call it Purchase. Bardolph stole a Lute-case,\\r\\nbore it twelue Leagues, and sold it for three halfepence.\\r\\nNim and Bardolph are sworne Brothers in filching: and\\r\\nin Callice they stole a fire-shouell. I knew by that peece\\r\\nof Seruice, the men would carry Coales. They would\\r\\nhaue me as familiar with mens Pockets, as their Gloues\\r\\nor their Hand-kerchers: which makes much against my\\r\\nManhood, if I should take from anothers Pocket, to put\\r\\ninto mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of Wrongs.\\r\\nI must leaue them, and seeke some better Seruice: their\\r\\nVillany goes against my weake stomacke, and therefore\\r\\nI must cast it vp.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Gower.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Gower. Captaine Fluellen, you must come presently to\\r\\nthe Mynes; the Duke of Gloucester would speake with\\r\\nyou\\r\\n\\r\\n   Flu. To the Mynes? Tell you the Duke, it is not so\\r\\ngood to come to the Mynes: for looke you, the Mynes\\r\\nis not according to the disciplines of the Warre; the concauities\\r\\nof it is not sufficient: for looke you, th\\' athuersarie,\\r\\nyou may discusse vnto the Duke, looke you, is digt\\r\\nhimselfe foure yard vnder the Countermines: by Cheshu,\\r\\nI thinke a will plowe vp all, if there is not better directions\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gower. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the Order\\r\\nof the Siege is giuen, is altogether directed by an Irish\\r\\nman, a very valiant Gentleman yfaith\\r\\n\\r\\n   Welch. It is Captaine Makmorrice, is it not?\\r\\n  Gower. I thinke it be\\r\\n\\r\\n   Welch. By Cheshu he is an Asse, as in the World, I will\\r\\nverifie as much in his Beard: he ha\\'s no more directions\\r\\nin the true disciplines of the Warres, looke you, of the\\r\\nRoman disciplines, then is a Puppy-dog.\\r\\nEnter Makmorrice, and Captaine Iamy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Gower. Here a comes, and the Scots Captaine, Captaine\\r\\nIamy, with him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Welch. Captaine Iamy is a maruellous falorous Gentleman,\\r\\nthat is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge\\r\\nin th\\' aunchiant Warres, vpon my particular knowledge\\r\\nof his directions: by Cheshu he will maintaine his\\r\\nArgument as well as any Militarie man in the World, in\\r\\nthe disciplines of the Pristine Warres of the Romans\\r\\n\\r\\n   Scot. I say gudday, Captaine Fluellen\\r\\n\\r\\n   Welch. Godden to your Worship, good Captaine\\r\\nIames\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gower. How now Captaine Mackmorrice, haue you\\r\\nquit the Mynes? haue the Pioners giuen o\\'re?\\r\\n  Irish. By Chrish Law tish ill done: the Worke ish\\r\\ngiue ouer, the Trompet sound the Retreat. By my Hand\\r\\nI sweare, and my fathers Soule, the Worke ish ill done:\\r\\nit ish giue ouer: I would haue blowed vp the Towne,\\r\\nso Chrish saue me law, in an houre. O tish ill done, tish ill\\r\\ndone: by my Hand tish ill done\\r\\n\\r\\n   Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I beseech you now,\\r\\nwill you voutsafe me, looke you, a few disputations with\\r\\nyou, as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of\\r\\nthe Warre, the Roman Warres, in the way of Argument,\\r\\nlooke you, and friendly communication: partly to satisfie\\r\\nmy Opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, looke you, of\\r\\nmy Mind: as touching the direction of the Militarie discipline,\\r\\nthat is the Point\\r\\n\\r\\n   Scot. It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud Captens bath,\\r\\nand I sall quit you with gud leue, as I may pick occasion:\\r\\nthat sall I mary\\r\\n\\r\\n   Irish. It is no time to discourse, so Chrish saue me:\\r\\nthe day is hot, and the Weather, and the Warres, and the\\r\\nKing, and the Dukes: it is no time to discourse, the Town\\r\\nis beseech\\'d: and the Trumpet call vs to the breech, and\\r\\nwe talke, and be Chrish do nothing, tis shame for vs all:\\r\\nso God sa\\'me tis shame to stand still, it is shame by my\\r\\nhand: and there is Throats to be cut, and Workes to be\\r\\ndone, and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa\\'me law\\r\\n\\r\\n   Scot. By the Mes, ere theise eyes of mine take themselues\\r\\nto slomber, ayle de gud seruice, or Ile ligge i\\'th\\'\\r\\ngrund for it; ay, or goe to death: and Ile pay\\'t as valorously\\r\\nas I may, that sal I suerly do, that is the breff and\\r\\nthe long: mary, I wad full faine heard some question\\r\\ntween you tway\\r\\n\\r\\n   Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I thinke, looke you,\\r\\nvnder your correction, there is not many of your Nation\\r\\n\\r\\n   Irish. Of my Nation? What ish my Nation? Ish a\\r\\nVillaine, and a Basterd, and a Knaue, and a Rascall. What\\r\\nish my Nation? Who talkes of my Nation?\\r\\n  Welch. Looke you, if you take the matter otherwise\\r\\nthen is meant, Captaine Mackmorrice, peraduenture I\\r\\nshall thinke you doe not vse me with that affabilitie, as in\\r\\ndiscretion you ought to vse me, looke you, being as good\\r\\na man as your selfe, both in the disciplines of Warre, and\\r\\nin the deriuation of my Birth, and in other particularities\\r\\n\\r\\n   Irish. I doe not know you so good a man as my selfe:\\r\\nso Chrish saue me, I will cut off your Head\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gower. Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other\\r\\n\\r\\n   Scot. A, that\\'s a foule fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Parley.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Gower. The Towne sounds a Parley\\r\\n\\r\\n   Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, when there is more\\r\\nbetter oportunitie to be required, looke you, I will be\\r\\nso bold as to tell you, I know the disciplines of Warre:\\r\\nand there is an end.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter the King and all his Traine before the Gates.\\r\\n\\r\\n  King.

How now Captaine Fluellen, come you from\\r\\nthe Bridge?\\r\\n  Flu. I assure you, there is very excellent Seruices committed\\r\\nat the Bridge\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gower. Is the Duke of Exeter safe?\\r\\n  Flu. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,\\r\\nand a man that I loue and honour with my soule,\\r\\nand my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing,\\r\\nand my vttermost power. He is not, God be praysed and\\r\\nblessed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge\\r\\nmost valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient\\r\\nLieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very\\r\\nconscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony, and\\r\\nhee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did see\\r\\nhim doe as gallant seruice\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gower. What doe you call him?\\r\\n  Flu. Hee is call\\'d aunchient Pistoll\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gower. I know him not.\\r\\nEnter Pistoll.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Flu. Here is the man\\r\\n\\r\\n   Pist. Captaine, I thee beseech to doe me fauours: the\\r\\nDuke of Exeter doth loue thee well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Flu. I, I prayse God, and I haue merited some loue at\\r\\nhis hands\\r\\n\\r\\n   Pist. Bardolph, a Souldier firme and sound of heart,\\r\\nand of buxome valour, hath by cruell Fate, and giddie\\r\\nFortunes furious fickle Wheele, that Goddesse blind, that\\r\\nstands vpon the rolling restlesse Stone\\r\\n\\r\\n   Flu. By your patience, aunchient Pistoll: Fortune is\\r\\npainted blinde, with a Muffler afore his eyes, to signifie\\r\\nto you, that Fortune is blinde; and shee is painted also\\r\\nwith a Wheele, to signifie to you, which is the Morall of\\r\\nit, that shee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie,\\r\\nand variation: and her foot, looke you, is fixed vpon a\\r\\nSphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles:\\r\\nin good truth, the Poet makes a most excellent description\\r\\nof it: Fortune is an excellent Morall\\r\\n\\r\\n   Pist. Fortune is Bardolphs foe, and frownes on him:\\r\\nfor he hath stolne a Pax, and hanged must a be: a damned\\r\\ndeath: let Gallowes gape for Dogge, let Man goe free,\\r\\nand let not Hempe his Wind-pipe suffocate: but Exeter\\r\\nhath giuen the doome of death, for Pax of little price.\\r\\nTherefore goe speake, the Duke will heare thy voyce;\\r\\nand let not Bardolphs vitall thred bee cut with edge of\\r\\nPenny-Cord, and vile reproach. Speake Captaine for\\r\\nhis Life, and I will thee requite\\r\\n\\r\\n   Flu. Aunchient Pistoll, I doe partly vnderstand your\\r\\nmeaning\\r\\n\\r\\n   Pist. Why then reioyce therefore\\r\\n\\r\\n   Flu. Certainly Aunchient, it is not a thing to reioyce\\r\\nat: for if, looke you, he were my Brother, I would desire\\r\\nthe Duke to vse his good pleasure, and put him to execution;\\r\\nfor discipline ought to be vsed\\r\\n\\r\\n   Pist. Dye, and be dam\\'d, and Figo for thy friendship\\r\\n\\r\\n   Flu. It is well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Pist. The Figge of Spaine.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Flu. Very good\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gower. Why, this is an arrant counterfeit Rascall, I\\r\\nremember him now: a Bawd, a Cut-purse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Flu. Ile assure you, a vtt\\'red as praue words at the\\r\\nPridge, as you shall see in a Summers day: but it is very\\r\\nwell: what he ha\\'s spoke to me, that is well I warrant you,\\r\\nwhen time is serue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gower. Why \\'tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and\\r\\nthen goes to the Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne\\r\\ninto London, vnder the forme of a Souldier: and such\\r\\nfellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names, and\\r\\nthey will learne you by rote where Seruices were done;\\r\\nat such and such a Sconce, at such a Breach, at such a Conuoy:\\r\\nwho came off brauely, who was shot, who disgrac\\'d,\\r\\nwhat termes the Enemy stood on: and this they\\r\\nconne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they tricke\\r\\nvp with new-tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Generalls\\r\\nCut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe among\\r\\nfoming Bottles, and Ale-washt Wits, is wonderfull\\r\\nto be thought on: but you must learne to know such\\r\\nslanders of the age, or else you may be maruellously mistooke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Flu. I tell you what, Captaine Gower: I doe perceiue\\r\\nhee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to\\r\\nthe World hee is: if I finde a hole in his Coat, I will tell\\r\\nhim my minde: hearke you, the King is comming, and I\\r\\nmust speake with him from the Pridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrum and Colours. Enter the King and his poore Souldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Flu. God plesse your Maiestie\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. How now Fluellen, cam\\'st thou from the Bridge?\\r\\n  Flu. I, so please your Maiestie: The Duke of Exeter\\r\\nha\\'s very gallantly maintain\\'d the Pridge; the French is\\r\\ngone off, looke you, and there is gallant and most praue\\r\\npassages: marry, th\\' athuersarie was haue possession of\\r\\nthe Pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the Duke of\\r\\nExeter is Master of the Pridge: I can tell your Maiestie,\\r\\nthe Duke is a praue man\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. What men haue you lost, Fluellen?\\r\\n  Flu. The perdition of th\\' athuersarie hath beene very\\r\\ngreat, reasonnable great: marry for my part, I thinke the\\r\\nDuke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be executed\\r\\nfor robbing a Church, one Bardolph, if your Maiestie\\r\\nknow the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes,\\r\\nand knobs, and flames a fire, and his lippes blowes at his\\r\\nnose, and it is like a coale of fire, sometimes plew, and\\r\\nsometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire\\'s\\r\\nout\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Wee would haue all such offendors so cut off:\\r\\nand we giue expresse charge, that in our Marches through\\r\\nthe Countrey, there be nothing compell\\'d from the Villages;\\r\\nnothing taken, but pay\\'d for: none of the French\\r\\nvpbrayded or abused in disdainefull Language; for when\\r\\nLeuitie and Crueltie play for a Kingdome, the gentler\\r\\nGamester is the soonest winner.\\r\\n\\r\\nTucket. Enter Mountioy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mountioy. You know me by my habit\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Well then, I know thee: what shall I know of\\r\\nthee?\\r\\n  Mountioy. My Masters mind\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Vnfold it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mountioy. Thus sayes my King: Say thou to Harry\\r\\nof England, Though we seem\\'d dead, we did but sleepe:\\r\\nAduantage is a better Souldier then rashnesse. Tell him,\\r\\nwee could haue rebuk\\'d him at Harflewe, but that wee\\r\\nthought not good to bruise an iniurie, till it were full\\r\\nripe. Now wee speake vpon our Q. and our voyce is imperiall:\\r\\nEngland shall repent his folly, see his weakenesse,\\r\\nand admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider\\r\\nof his ransome, which must proportion the losses we\\r\\nhaue borne, the subiects we haue lost, the disgrace we\\r\\nhaue digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettinesse\\r\\nwould bow vnder. For our losses, his Exchequer is\\r\\ntoo poore; for th\\' effusion of our bloud, the Muster of his\\r\\nKingdome too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his\\r\\nowne person kneeling at our feet, but a weake and worthlesse\\r\\nsatisfaction. To this adde defiance: and tell him for\\r\\nconclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation\\r\\nis pronounc\\'t: So farre my King and Master;\\r\\nso much my Office\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. What is thy name? I know thy qualitie\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mount. Mountioy\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Thou doo\\'st thy Office fairely.

Yet forgiue me God,\\r\\nThat I doe bragge thus; this your ayre of France\\r\\nHath blowne that vice in me.

Tut, I haue the best Armour of the World:\\r\\nwould it were day\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance. You haue an excellent Armour: but let my\\r\\nHorse haue his due\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const.

I will not change\\r\\nmy Horse with any that treades but on foure postures:\\r\\nch\\' ha: he bounds from the Earth, as if his entrayles were\\r\\nhayres: le Cheual volante, the Pegasus, ches les narines de\\r\\nfeu. When I bestryde him, I soare, I am a Hawke: he trots\\r\\nthe ayre: the Earth sings, when he touches it: the basest\\r\\nhorne of his hoofe, is more Musicall then the Pipe of\\r\\nHermes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance. Hee\\'s of the colour of the Nutmeg\\r\\n\\r\\n   Dolph. And of the heat of the Ginger. It is a Beast\\r\\nfor Perseus: hee is pure Ayre and Fire; and the dull Elements\\r\\nof Earth and Water neuer appeare in him, but only\\r\\nin patient stillnesse while his Rider mounts him: hee\\r\\nis indeede a Horse, and all other Iades you may call\\r\\nBeasts\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. Indeed my Lord, it is a most absolute and excellent\\r\\nHorse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Dolph. It is the Prince of Palfrayes, his Neigh is like\\r\\nthe bidding of a Monarch, and his countenance enforces\\r\\nHomage\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance. No more Cousin\\r\\n\\r\\n   Dolph. Nay, the man hath no wit, that cannot from\\r\\nthe rising of the Larke to the lodging of the Lambe,\\r\\nvarie deserued prayse on my Palfray: it is a Theame as\\r\\nfluent as the Sea: Turne the Sands into eloquent tongues,\\r\\nand my Horse is argument for them all: \\'tis a subiect\\r\\nfor a Soueraigne to reason on, and for a Soueraignes Soueraigne\\r\\nto ride on: And for the World, familiar to vs,\\r\\nand vnknowne, to lay apart their particular Functions,\\r\\nand wonder at him, I once writ a Sonnet in his prayse,\\r\\nand began thus, Wonder of Nature\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance.

You haue good iudgement in Horsemanship\\r\\n\\r\\n   Dolph. Be warn\\'d by me then: they that ride so, and\\r\\nride not warily, fall into foule Boggs: I had rather haue\\r\\nmy Horse to my Mistresse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. I had as liue haue my Mistresse a Iade\\r\\n\\r\\n   Dolph. I tell thee Constable, my Mistresse weares his\\r\\nowne hayre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a\\r\\nSow to my Mistresse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Dolph. Le chien est retourne a son propre vemissement est\\r\\nla leuye lauee au bourbier: thou mak\\'st vse of any thing\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. Yet doe I not vse my Horse for my Mistresse,\\r\\nor any such Prouerbe, so little kin to the purpose\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ramb. My Lord Constable, the Armour that I saw in\\r\\nyour Tent to night, are those Starres or Sunnes vpon it?\\r\\n  Const. Starres my Lord\\r\\n\\r\\n   Dolph. Some of them will fall to morrow, I hope\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. And yet my Sky shall not want\\r\\n\\r\\n   Dolph. That may be, for you beare a many superfluously,\\r\\nand \\'twere more honor some were away\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. Eu\\'n as your Horse beares your prayses, who\\r\\nwould trot as well, were some of your bragges dismounted\\r\\n\\r\\n   Dolph. Would I were able to loade him with his desert.\\r\\nWill it neuer be day? I will trot to morrow a mile,\\r\\nand my way shall be paued with English Faces\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. I will not say so, for feare I should be fac\\'t out\\r\\nof my way: but I would it were morning, for I would\\r\\nfaine be about the eares of the English\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ramb. Who will goe to Hazard with me for twentie\\r\\nPrisoners?\\r\\n  Const. You must first goe your selfe to hazard, ere you\\r\\nhaue them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Dolph. \\'Tis Mid-night, Ile goe arme my selfe.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Orleance. The Dolphin longs for morning\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ramb. He longs to eate the English\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. I thinke he will eate all he kills\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance.

I was told that, by one that knowes him better\\r\\nthen you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance. What\\'s hee?\\r\\n  Const. Marry hee told me so himselfe, and hee sayd hee\\r\\ncar\\'d not who knew it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance. Hee needes not, it is no hidden vertue in\\r\\nhim\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. By my faith Sir, but it is: neuer any body saw\\r\\nit, but his Lacquey: \\'tis a hooded valour, and when it\\r\\nappeares, it will bate\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance.

A valiant and most expert Gentleman. Would\\r\\nit were day? Alas poore Harry of England: hee longs\\r\\nnot for the Dawning, as wee doe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance. What a wretched and peeuish fellow is this\\r\\nKing of England, to mope with his fat-brain\\'d followers\\r\\nso farre out of his knowledge\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. If the English had any apprehension, they\\r\\nwould runne away\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance. That they lack: for if their heads had any intellectuall\\r\\nArmour, they could neuer weare such heauie\\r\\nHead-pieces\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ramb. That Iland of England breedes very valiant\\r\\nCreatures; their Mastiffes are of vnmatchable courage\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance. Foolish Curres, that runne winking into\\r\\nthe mouth of a Russian Beare, and haue their heads crusht\\r\\nlike rotten Apples: you may as well say, that\\'s a valiant\\r\\nFlea, that dare eate his breakefast on the Lippe of a\\r\\nLyon\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. Iust, iust: and the men doe sympathize with\\r\\nthe Mastiffes, in robustious and rough comming on,\\r\\nleauing their Wits with their Wiues: and then giue\\r\\nthem great Meales of Beefe, and Iron and Steele; they\\r\\nwill eate like Wolues, and fight like Deuils\\r\\n\\r\\n   Orleance. I, but these English are shrowdly out of\\r\\nBeefe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Const. Then shall we finde to morrow, they haue only\\r\\nstomackes to eate, and none to fight. Now is it time to\\r\\narme: come, shall we about it?\\r\\n  Orleance.

Brother Iohn Bates, is not that the Morning\\r\\nwhich breakes yonder?\\r\\n  Bates. I thinke it be: but wee haue no great cause to\\r\\ndesire the approach of day\\r\\n\\r\\n   Williams. Wee see yonder the beginning of the day,\\r\\nbut I thinke wee shall neuer see the end of it. Who goes\\r\\nthere?\\r\\n  King. A Friend\\r\\n\\r\\n   Williams. Vnder what Captaine serue you?\\r\\n  King. Vnder Sir Iohn Erpingham\\r\\n\\r\\n   Williams. A good old Commander, and a most kinde\\r\\nGentleman: I pray you, what thinkes he of our estate?\\r\\n  King. Euen as men wrackt vpon a Sand, that looke to\\r\\nbe washt off the next Tyde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bates. He hath not told his thought to the King?\\r\\n  King. No: nor it is not meet he should: for though I\\r\\nspeake it to you, I thinke the King is but a man, as I am:\\r\\nthe Violet smells to him, as it doth to me; the Element\\r\\nshewes to him, as it doth to me; all his Sences haue but\\r\\nhumane Conditions: his Ceremonies layd by, in his Nakednesse\\r\\nhe appeares but a man; and though his affections\\r\\nare higher mounted then ours, yet when they stoupe,\\r\\nthey stoupe with the like wing: therefore, when he sees\\r\\nreason of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of\\r\\nthe same rellish as ours are: yet in reason, no man should\\r\\npossesse him with any appearance of feare; least hee, by\\r\\nshewing it, should dis-hearten his Army\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bates. He may shew what outward courage he will:\\r\\nbut I beleeue, as cold a Night as \\'tis, hee could wish himselfe\\r\\nin Thames vp to the Neck; and so I would he were,\\r\\nand I by him, at all aduentures, so we were quit here\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. By my troth, I will speake my conscience of the\\r\\nKing: I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where,\\r\\nbut where hee is\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bates. Then I would he were here alone; so should he be\\r\\nsure to be ransomed, and a many poore mens liues saued\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. I dare say, you loue him not so ill, to wish him\\r\\nhere alone: howsoeuer you speake this to feele other\\r\\nmens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where so contented,\\r\\nas in the Kings company; his Cause being iust, and\\r\\nhis Quarrell honorable\\r\\n\\r\\n   Williams. That\\'s more then we know\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bates. I, or more then wee should seeke after; for wee\\r\\nknow enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects:\\r\\nif his Cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes\\r\\nthe Cryme of it out of vs\\r\\n\\r\\n   Williams. But if the Cause be not good, the King himselfe\\r\\nhath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all those\\r\\nLegges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt off in a Battaile,\\r\\nshall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dyed\\r\\nat such a place, some swearing, some crying for a Surgean;\\r\\nsome vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them;\\r\\nsome vpon the Debts they owe, some vpon their Children\\r\\nrawly left: I am afear\\'d, there are few dye well, that dye\\r\\nin a Battaile: for how can they charitably dispose of any\\r\\nthing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if these men\\r\\ndoe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King,\\r\\nthat led them to it; who to disobey, were against all proportion\\r\\nof subiection\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. So, if a Sonne that is by his Father sent about\\r\\nMerchandize, doe sinfully miscarry vpon the Sea; the imputation\\r\\nof his wickednesse, by your rule, should be imposed\\r\\nvpon his Father that sent him: or if a Seruant, vnder\\r\\nhis Masters command, transporting a summe of Money,\\r\\nbe assayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil\\'d\\r\\nIniquities; you may call the businesse of the Master the\\r\\nauthor of the Seruants damnation: but this is not so:\\r\\nThe King is not bound to answer the particular endings\\r\\nof his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Master\\r\\nof his Seruant; for they purpose not their death, when\\r\\nthey purpose their seruices. Besides, there is no King, be\\r\\nhis Cause neuer so spotlesse, if it come to the arbitrement\\r\\nof Swords, can trye it out with all vnspotted Souldiers:\\r\\nsome (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of\\r\\npremeditated and contriued Murther; some, of beguiling\\r\\nVirgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; some,\\r\\nmaking the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before gored\\r\\nthe gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robberie.\\r\\nNow, if these men haue defeated the Law, and outrunne\\r\\nNatiue punishment; though they can out-strip\\r\\nmen, they haue no wings to flye from God. Warre is\\r\\nhis Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: so that here men\\r\\nare punisht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in\\r\\nnow the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death,\\r\\nthey haue borne life away; and where they would bee\\r\\nsafe, they perish. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more\\r\\nis the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was before\\r\\nguiltie of those Impieties, for the which they are\\r\\nnow visited. Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings, but\\r\\neuery Subiects Soule is his owne. Therefore should\\r\\neuery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery sicke man in\\r\\nhis Bed, wash euery Moth out of his Conscience: and\\r\\ndying so, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying,\\r\\nthe time was blessedly lost, wherein such preparation was\\r\\ngayned: and in him that escapes, it were not sinne to\\r\\nthinke, that making God so free an offer, he let him outliue\\r\\nthat day, to see his Greatnesse, and to teach others\\r\\nhow they should prepare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Will. \\'Tis certaine, euery man that dyes ill, the ill vpon\\r\\nhis owne head, the King is not to answer it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bates. I doe not desire hee should answer for me, and\\r\\nyet I determine to fight lustily for him\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. I my selfe heard the King say he would not be\\r\\nransom\\'d\\r\\n\\r\\n   Will. I, hee said so, to make vs fight chearefully: but\\r\\nwhen our throats are cut, hee may be ransom\\'d, and wee\\r\\nne\\'re the wiser\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. If I liue to see it, I will neuer trust his word after\\r\\n\\r\\n   Will. You pay him then: that\\'s a perillous shot out\\r\\nof an Elder Gunne, that a poore and a priuate displeasure\\r\\ncan doe against a Monarch: you may as well goe about\\r\\nto turne the Sunne to yce, with fanning in his face with a\\r\\nPeacocks feather: You\\'le neuer trust his word after;\\r\\ncome, \\'tis a foolish saying\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Your reproofe is something too round, I should\\r\\nbe angry with you, if the time were conuenient\\r\\n\\r\\n   Will. Let it bee a Quarrell betweene vs, if you\\r\\nliue\\r\\n\\r\\n   King.

Alexander God knowes, and you know, in his\\r\\nrages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his chollers, and\\r\\nhis moodes, and his displeasures, and his indignations,\\r\\nand also being a little intoxicates in his praines, did in\\r\\nhis Ales and his angers (looke you) kill his best friend\\r\\nClytus\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gow. Our King is not like him in that, he neuer kill\\'d\\r\\nany of his friends\\r\\n\\r\\n   Flu. It is not well done (marke you now) to take the\\r\\ntales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak\\r\\nbut in the figures, and comparisons of it: as Alexander\\r\\nkild his friend Clytus, being in his Ales and his Cuppes; so\\r\\nalso Harry Monmouth being in his right wittes, and his\\r\\ngood iudgements, turn\\'d away the fat Knight with the\\r\\ngreat belly doublet: he was full of iests, and gypes, and\\r\\nknaueries, and mockes, I haue forgot his name\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gow.

Take a Trumpet Herald,\\r\\nRide thou vnto the Horsemen on yond hill:\\r\\nIf they will fight with vs, bid them come downe,\\r\\nOr voyde the field: they do offend our sight.\\r\\nIf they\\'l do neither, we will come to them,\\r\\nAnd make them sker away, as swift as stones\\r\\nEnforced from the old Assyrian slings:\\r\\nBesides, wee\\'l cut the throats of those we haue,\\r\\nAnd not a man of them that we shall take,\\r\\nShall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.\\r\\nEnter Montioy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Exe. Here comes the Herald of the French, my Liege\\r\\n  Glou. His eyes are humbler then they vs\\'d to be\\r\\n\\r\\n   King.

No great King:\\r\\nI come to thee for charitable License,\\r\\nThat we may wander ore this bloody field,\\r\\nTo booke our dead, and then to bury them,\\r\\nTo sort our Nobles from our common men.\\r\\nFor many of our Princes (woe the while)\\r\\nLye drown\\'d and soak\\'d in mercenary blood:\\r\\nSo do our vulgar drench their peasant limbes\\r\\nIn blood of Princes, and with wounded steeds\\r\\nFret fet-locke deepe in gore, and with wilde rage\\r\\nYerke out their armed heeles at their dead masters,\\r\\nKilling them twice. O giue vs leaue great King,\\r\\nTo view the field in safety, and dispose\\r\\nOf their dead bodies\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kin.

Praised be God, and not our strength for it:\\r\\nWhat is this Castle call\\'d that stands hard by\\r\\n\\r\\n   Her. They call it Agincourt\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Then call we this the field of Agincourt,\\r\\nFought on the day of Crispin Crispianus\\r\\n\\r\\n   Flu.

My dutie to you both, on equall loue.\\r\\nGreat Kings of France and England: that I haue labour\\'d\\r\\nWith all my wits, my paines, and strong endeuors,\\r\\nTo bring your most Imperiall Maiesties\\r\\nVnto this Barre, and Royall enterview;\\r\\nYour Mightinesse on both parts best can witnesse.\\r\\nSince then my Office hath so farre preuayl\\'d,\\r\\nThat Face to Face, and Royall Eye to Eye,\\r\\nYou haue congreeted: let it not disgrace me,\\r\\nIf I demand before this Royall view,\\r\\nWhat Rub, or what Impediment there is,\\r\\nWhy that the naked, poore, and mangled Peace,\\r\\nDeare Nourse of Arts, Plentyes, and ioyfull Births,\\r\\nShould not in this best Garden of the World,\\r\\nOur fertile France, put vp her louely Visage?\\r\\nAlas, shee hath from France too long been chas\\'d,\\r\\nAnd all her Husbandry doth lye on heapes,\\r\\nCorrupting in it owne fertilitie.\\r\\nHer Vine, the merry chearer of the heart,\\r\\nVnpruned, dyes: her Hedges euen pleach\\'d,\\r\\nLike Prisoners wildly ouer-growne with hayre,\\r\\nPut forth disorder\\'d Twigs: her fallow Leas,\\r\\nThe Darnell, Hemlock, and ranke Femetary,\\r\\nDoth root vpon; while that the Culter rusts,\\r\\nThat should deracinate such Sauagery:\\r\\nThe euen Meade, that erst brought sweetly forth\\r\\nThe freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and greene Clouer,\\r\\nWanting the Sythe, withall vncorrected, ranke;\\r\\nConceiues by idlenesse, and nothing teemes,\\r\\nBut hatefull Docks, rough Thistles, Keksyes, Burres,\\r\\nLoosing both beautie and vtilitie;\\r\\nAnd all our Vineyards, Fallowes, Meades, and Hedges,\\r\\nDefectiue in their natures, grow to wildnesse.\\r\\nEuen so our Houses, and our selues, and Children,\\r\\nHaue lost, or doe not learne, for want of time,\\r\\nThe Sciences that should become our Countrey;\\r\\nBut grow like Sauages, as Souldiers will,\\r\\nThat nothing doe, but meditate on Blood,\\r\\nTo Swearing, and sterne Lookes, defus\\'d Attyre,\\r\\nAnd euery thing that seemes vnnaturall.\\r\\nWhich to reduce into our former fauour,\\r\\nYou are assembled: and my speech entreats,\\r\\nThat I may know the Let, why gentle Peace\\r\\nShould not expell these inconueniences,\\r\\nAnd blesse vs with her former qualities\\r\\n\\r\\n   Eng. If Duke of Burgonie, you would the Peace,\\r\\nWhose want giues growth to th\\' imperfections\\r\\nWhich you haue cited; you must buy that Peace\\r\\nWith full accord to all our iust demands,\\r\\nWhose Tenures and particular effects\\r\\nYou haue enschedul\\'d briefely in your hands\\r\\n\\r\\n   Burg. The King hath heard them: to the which, as yet\\r\\nThere is no Answer made\\r\\n\\r\\n   Eng. Well then: the Peace which you before so vrg\\'d,\\r\\nLyes in his Answer\\r\\n\\r\\n   France. I haue but with a curselarie eye\\r\\nO\\'re-glanc\\'t the Articles: Pleaseth your Grace\\r\\nTo appoint some of your Councell presently\\r\\nTo sit with vs once more, with better heed\\r\\nTo re-suruey them; we will suddenly\\r\\nPasse our accept and peremptorie Answer\\r\\n\\r\\n   England. Brother we shall. Goe Vnckle Exeter,\\r\\nAnd Brother Clarence, and you Brother Gloucester,\\r\\nWarwick, and Huntington, goe with the King,\\r\\nAnd take with you free power, to ratifie,\\r\\nAugment, or alter, as your Wisdomes best\\r\\nShall see aduantageable for our Dignitie,\\r\\nAny thing in or out of our Demands,\\r\\nAnd wee\\'le consigne thereto. Will you, faire Sister,\\r\\nGoe with the Princes, or stay here with vs?\\r\\n  Quee. Our gracious Brother, I will goe with them:\\r\\nHappily a Womans Voyce may doe some good,\\r\\nWhen Articles too nicely vrg\\'d, be stood on\\r\\n\\r\\n   England. Yet leaue our Cousin Katherine here with vs,\\r\\nShe is our capitall Demand, compris\\'d\\r\\nWithin the fore-ranke of our Articles\\r\\n\\r\\n   Quee. She hath good leaue.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt. omnes.\\r\\n\\r\\nManet King and Katherine\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Faire Katherine, and most faire,\\r\\nWill you vouchsafe to teach a Souldier tearmes,\\r\\nSuch as will enter at a Ladyes eare,\\r\\nAnd pleade his Loue-suit to her gentle heart\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kath. Your Maiestie shall mock at me, I cannot speake\\r\\nyour England\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. O faire Katherine, if you will loue me soundly\\r\\nwith your French heart, I will be glad to heare you confesse\\r\\nit brokenly with your English Tongue. Doe you\\r\\nlike me, Kate?\\r\\n  Kath. Pardonne moy, I cannot tell wat is like me\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. An Angell is like you Kate, and you are like an\\r\\nAngell\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kath. Que dit il que Ie suis semblable a les Anges?\\r\\n  Lady. Ouy verayment (sauf vostre Grace) ainsi dit il\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. I said so, deare Katherine, and I must not blush\\r\\nto affirme it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kath. O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont plein de\\r\\ntromperies\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. What sayes she, faire one? that the tongues of\\r\\nmen are full of deceits?\\r\\n  Lady. Ouy, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits:\\r\\ndat is de Princesse\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. The Princesse is the better English-woman:\\r\\nyfaith Kate, my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding, I am\\r\\nglad thou canst speake no better English, for if thou\\r\\ncould\\'st, thou would\\'st finde me such a plaine King, that\\r\\nthou wouldst thinke, I had sold my Farme to buy my\\r\\nCrowne. I know no wayes to mince it in loue, but directly\\r\\nto say, I loue you; then if you vrge me farther,\\r\\nthen to say, Doe you in faith? I weare out my suite: Giue\\r\\nme your answer, yfaith doe, and so clap hands, and a bargaine:\\r\\nhow say you, Lady?\\r\\n  Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, me vnderstand well\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Marry, if you would put me to Verses, or to\\r\\nDance for your sake, Kate, why you vndid me: for the one\\r\\nI haue neither words nor measure; and for the other, I\\r\\nhaue no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in\\r\\nstrength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape-frogge, or by\\r\\nvawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe;\\r\\nvnder the correction of bragging be it spoken. I should\\r\\nquickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might buffet for my\\r\\nLoue, or bound my Horse for her fauours, I could lay on\\r\\nlike a Butcher, and sit like a Iack an Apes, neuer off. But\\r\\nbefore God Kate, I cannot looke greenely, nor gaspe out\\r\\nmy eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in protestation;\\r\\nonely downe-right Oathes, which I neuer vse till vrg\\'d,\\r\\nnor neuer breake for vrging. If thou canst loue a fellow\\r\\nof this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth Sunne-burning?\\r\\nthat neuer lookes in his Glasse, for loue of any\\r\\nthing he sees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I speake\\r\\nto thee plaine Souldier: If thou canst loue me for this,\\r\\ntake me? if not? to say to thee that I shall dye, is true; but\\r\\nfor thy loue, by the L[ord]. No: yet I loue thee too. And\\r\\nwhile thou liu\\'st, deare Kate, take a fellow of plaine and\\r\\nvncoyned Constancie, for he perforce must do thee right,\\r\\nbecause he hath not the gift to wooe in other places: for\\r\\nthese fellowes of infinit tongue, that can ryme themselues\\r\\ninto Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes reason themselues\\r\\nout againe. What? a speaker is but a prater, a Ryme is\\r\\nbut a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a strait Backe will\\r\\nstoope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl\\'d Pate will\\r\\ngrow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax\\r\\nhollow: but a good Heart, Kate, is the Sunne and the\\r\\nMoone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it\\r\\nshines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his course\\r\\ntruly. If thou would haue such a one, take me? and\\r\\ntake me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King.\\r\\nAnd what say\\'st thou then to my Loue? speake my faire,\\r\\nand fairely, I pray thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kath. Is it possible dat I sould loue de ennemie of\\r\\nFraunce?\\r\\n  King. No, it is not possible you should loue the Enemie\\r\\nof France, Kate; but in louing me, you should loue\\r\\nthe Friend of France: for I loue France so well, that I\\r\\nwill not part with a Village of it; I will haue it all mine:\\r\\nand Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours; then yours\\r\\nis France, and you are mine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kath. I cannot tell wat is dat\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am\\r\\nsure will hang vpon my tongue, like a new-married Wife\\r\\nabout her Husbands Necke, hardly to be shooke off; Ie\\r\\nquand sur le possession de Fraunce, & quand vous aues le\\r\\npossession\\r\\nde moy. (Let mee see, what then? Saint Dennis bee\\r\\nmy speede) Donc vostre est Fraunce, & vous estes mienne.\\r\\nIt is as easie for me, Kate, to conquer the Kingdome, as to\\r\\nspeake so much more French: I shall neuer moue thee in\\r\\nFrench, vnlesse it be to laugh at me\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, le Francois ques vous parleis, il\\r\\n& melieus que l\\' Anglois le quel Ie parle\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. No faith is\\'t not, Kate: but thy speaking of\\r\\nmy Tongue, and I thine, most truely falsely, must\\r\\nneedes be graunted to be much at one. But Kate, doo\\'st\\r\\nthou vnderstand thus much English? Canst thou loue\\r\\nmee?\\r\\n  Kath. I cannot tell\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Can any of your Neighbours tell, Kate? Ile\\r\\naske them. Come, I know thou louest me: and at night,\\r\\nwhen you come into your Closet, you\\'le question this\\r\\nGentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to\\r\\nher disprayse those parts in me, that you loue with your\\r\\nheart: but good Kate, mocke me mercifully, the rather\\r\\ngentle Princesse, because I loue thee cruelly. If euer thou\\r\\nbeest mine, Kate, as I haue a sauing Faith within me tells\\r\\nme thou shalt; I get thee with skambling, and thou\\r\\nmust therefore needes proue a good Souldier-breeder:\\r\\nShall not thou and I, betweene Saint Dennis and Saint\\r\\nGeorge, compound a Boy, halfe French halfe English,\\r\\nthat shall goe to Constantinople, and take the Turke by\\r\\nthe Beard. Shall wee not? what say\\'st thou, my faire\\r\\nFlower-de-Luce\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kate. I doe not know dat\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. No: \\'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise:\\r\\ndoe but now promise Kate, you will endeauour for your\\r\\nFrench part of such a Boy; and for my English moytie,\\r\\ntake the Word of a King, and a Batcheler. How answer\\r\\nyou. La plus belle Katherine du monde mon trescher & deuin\\r\\ndeesse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kath. Your Maiestee aue fause Frenche enough to\\r\\ndeceiue de most sage Damoiseil dat is en Fraunce\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Now fye vpon my false French: by mine Honor\\r\\nin true English, I loue thee Kate; by which Honor, I dare\\r\\nnot sweare thou louest me, yet my blood begins to flatter\\r\\nme, that thou doo\\'st; notwithstanding the poore and\\r\\nvntempering effect of my Visage. Now beshrew my\\r\\nFathers Ambition, hee was thinking of Ciuill Warres\\r\\nwhen hee got me, therefore was I created with a stubborne\\r\\nout-side, with an aspect of Iron, that when I come\\r\\nto wooe Ladyes, I fright them: but in faith Kate, the elder\\r\\nI wax, the better I shall appeare. My comfort is, that\\r\\nOld Age, that ill layer vp of Beautie, can doe no more\\r\\nspoyle vpon my Face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at\\r\\nthe worst; and thou shalt weare me, if thou weare me,\\r\\nbetter and better: and therefore tell me, most faire Katherine,\\r\\nwill you haue me? Put off your Maiden Blushes,\\r\\nauouch the Thoughts of your Heart with the Lookes of\\r\\nan Empresse, take me by the Hand, and say, Harry of\\r\\nEngland, I am thine: which Word thou shalt no sooner\\r\\nblesse mine Eare withall, but I will tell thee alowd, England\\r\\nis thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry\\r\\nPlantaginet is thine; who, though I speake it before his\\r\\nFace, if he be not Fellow with the best King, thou shalt\\r\\nfinde the best King of Good-fellowes. Come your Answer\\r\\nin broken Musick; for thy Voyce is Musick, and\\r\\nthy English broken: Therefore Queene of all, Katherine,\\r\\nbreake thy minde to me in broken English; wilt thou\\r\\nhaue me?\\r\\n  Kath. Dat is as it shall please de Roy mon pere\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please\\r\\nhim, Kate\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kath. Den it sall also content me\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Vpon that I kisse your Hand, and I call you my\\r\\nQueene\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kath. Laisse mon Seigneur, laisse, laisse, may foy: Ie ne\\r\\nveus point que vous abbaisse vostre grandeus, en baisant le\\r\\nmain d\\' une nostre Seigneur indignie seruiteur excuse moy. Ie\\r\\nvous supplie mon tres-puissant Seigneur\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Then I will kisse your Lippes, Kate\\r\\n\\r\\n   Kath. Les Dames & Damoisels pour estre baisee deuant\\r\\nleur nopcese il net pas le costume de Fraunce\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Madame, my Interpreter, what sayes shee?\\r\\n  Lady. Dat it is not be de fashon pour le Ladies of\\r\\nFraunce; I cannot tell wat is buisse en Anglish\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. To kisse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Your Maiestee entendre bettre que moy\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. It is not a fashion for the Maids in Fraunce to\\r\\nkisse before they are marryed, would she say?\\r\\n  Lady. Ouy verayment\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. O Kate, nice Customes cursie to great Kings.\\r\\nDeare Kate, you and I cannot bee confin\\'d within the\\r\\nweake Lyst of a Countreyes fashion: wee are the makers\\r\\nof Manners, Kate; and the libertie that followes\\r\\nour Places, stoppes the mouth of all finde-faults, as I\\r\\nwill doe yours, for vpholding the nice fashion of your\\r\\nCountrey, in denying me a Kisse: therefore patiently,\\r\\nand yeelding. You haue Witch-craft in your Lippes,\\r\\nKate: there is more eloquence in a Sugar touch of\\r\\nthem, then in the Tongues of the French Councell; and\\r\\nthey should sooner perswade Harry of England, then a\\r\\ngenerall Petition of Monarchs. Heere comes your\\r\\nFather.\\r\\nEnter the French Power, and the English Lords.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Burg. God saue your Maiestie, my Royall Cousin,\\r\\nteach you our Princesse English?\\r\\n  King. I would haue her learne, my faire Cousin, how\\r\\nperfectly I loue her, and that is good English\\r\\n\\r\\n   Burg. Is shee not apt?\\r\\n  King. Our Tongue is rough, Coze, and my Condition\\r\\nis not smooth: so that hauing neyther the Voyce nor\\r\\nthe Heart of Flatterie about me, I cannot so coniure vp\\r\\nthe Spirit of Loue in her, that hee will appeare in his true\\r\\nlikenesse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Burg. Pardon the franknesse of my mirth, if I answer\\r\\nyou for that. If you would coniure in her, you must\\r\\nmake a Circle: if coniure vp Loue in her in his true\\r\\nlikenesse, hee must appeare naked, and blinde. Can you\\r\\nblame her then, being a Maid, yet ros\\'d ouer with the\\r\\nVirgin Crimson of Modestie, if shee deny the apparance\\r\\nof a naked blinde Boy in her naked seeing selfe? It were\\r\\n(my Lord) a hard Condition for a Maid to consigne\\r\\nto\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Yet they doe winke and yeeld, as Loue is blind\\r\\nand enforces\\r\\n\\r\\n   Burg. They are then excus\\'d, my Lord, when they see\\r\\nnot what they doe\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Then good my Lord, teach your Cousin to\\r\\nconsent winking\\r\\n\\r\\n   Burg. I will winke on her to consent, my Lord, if you\\r\\nwill teach her to know my meaning: for Maides well\\r\\nSummer\\'d, and warme kept, are like Flyes at Bartholomew-tyde,\\r\\nblinde, though they haue their eyes, and then\\r\\nthey will endure handling, which before would not abide\\r\\nlooking on\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. This Morall tyes me ouer to Time, and a hot\\r\\nSummer; and so I shall catch the Flye, your Cousin, in\\r\\nthe latter end, and she must be blinde to\\r\\n\\r\\n   Burg. As Loue is my Lord, before it loues\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. It is so: and you may, some of you, thanke\\r\\nLoue for my blindnesse, who cannot see many a faire\\r\\nFrench Citie for one faire French Maid that stands in my\\r\\nway\\r\\n\\r\\n   French King. Yes my Lord, you see them perspectiuely:\\r\\nthe Cities turn\\'d into a Maid; for they are\\r\\nall gyrdled with Maiden Walls, that Warre hath entred\\r\\n\\r\\n   England. Shall Kate be my Wife?\\r\\n  France. So please you\\r\\n\\r\\n   England. I am content, so the Maiden Cities you\\r\\ntalke of, may wait on her: so the Maid that stood in\\r\\nthe way for my Wish, shall shew me the way to my\\r\\nWill\\r\\n\\r\\n   France. Wee haue consented to all tearmes of reason\\r\\n\\r\\n   England. Is\\'t so, my Lords of England?\\r\\n  West. The King hath graunted euery Article:\\r\\nHis Daughter first; and in sequele, all,\\r\\nAccording to their firme proposed natures\\r\\n\\r\\n   Exet. Onely he hath not yet subscribed this:\\r\\nWhere your Maiestie demands, That the King of France\\r\\nhauing any occasion to write for matter of Graunt, shall\\r\\nname your Highnesse in this forme, and with this addition,\\r\\nin French: Nostre trescher filz Henry Roy d\\' Angleterre\\r\\nHeretere de Fraunce: and thus in Latine; Praeclarissimus\\r\\nFilius noster Henricus Rex Angliæ & Heres Franciae\\r\\n\\r\\n   France. Nor this I haue not Brother so deny\\'d,\\r\\nBut your request shall make me let it passe\\r\\n\\r\\n   England. I pray you then, in loue and deare allyance,\\r\\nLet that one Article ranke with the rest,\\r\\nAnd thereupon giue me your Daughter\\r\\n\\r\\n   France. Take her faire Sonne, and from her blood rayse vp\\r\\nIssue to me, that the contending Kingdomes\\r\\nOf France and England, whose very shoares looke pale,\\r\\nWith enuy of each others happinesse,\\r\\nMay cease their hatred; and this deare Coniunction\\r\\nPlant Neighbour-hood and Christian-like accord\\r\\nIn their sweet Bosomes: that neuer Warre aduance\\r\\nHis bleeding Sword \\'twixt England and faire France\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lords. Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Now welcome Kate: and beare me witnesse all,\\r\\nThat here I kisse her as my Soueraigne Queene.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlourish.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Quee. God, the best maker of all Marriages,\\r\\nCombine your hearts in one, your Realmes in one:\\r\\nAs Man and Wife being two, are one in loue,\\r\\nSo be there \\'twixt your Kingdomes such a Spousall,\\r\\nThat neuer may ill Office, or fell Iealousie,\\r\\nWhich troubles oft the Bed of blessed Marriage,\\r\\nThrust in betweene the Paction of these Kingdomes,\\r\\nTo make diuorce of their incorporate League:\\r\\nThat English may as French, French Englishmen,\\r\\nReceiue each other. God speake this Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   All. Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   King. Prepare we for our Marriage: on which day,\\r\\nMy Lord of Burgundy wee\\'le take your Oath\\r\\nAnd all the Peeres, for suretie of our Leagues.\\r\\nThen shall I sweare to Kate, and you to me,\\r\\nAnd may our Oathes well kept and prosp\\'rous be.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenet.
